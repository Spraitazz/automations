trash_post1 = """Ambiguity Is the Enemy

Natural language is inherently vague. You say "Make a fast search hashtag#function," but:

What is "fast"? Milliseconds? Seconds?
For how much data?
What is being searched? Text? Images?

Programming, in contrast, is all about precision. hashtag#Computers don't "get the vibe". They follow rules. If you say the wrong thing, the system doesn't politely guess what you meant. It just explodes (or worse, silently fails).

🔸️ Context Collapse

Human language relies heavily on shared context. You and I might say "use that old parser," and we both know it's the hashtag#JSON one from last week. But a machine? Unless it tracks state, history, intentions, user roles, previous decisions, etc., it's flying blind.

This is why "natural language programming" often turns into repetitive, overly wordy, pseudo-code-like instructions that try to imitate hashtag#code but aren't as good as the real thing.

🔸️ The Curse of Infinite Interpretations

One sentence in English can have 10 valid meanings, and different users will express the same idea ten different ways. This breaks the idea of consistent hashtag#APIs, which are the lifeblood of hashtag#software development.

🔸️ Non-determinism = Bugs

Natural language models often generate non-deterministic outputs. If I give a prompt twice, I might get two different solutions. That's wildly dangerous in production code. Imagine your login system changing behavior depending on the day.

trash_post2 = """LinkedIn is flooded with terrible job search advice for engineers.

"Apply to 50 jobs a day!"
"Customize every resume!"
"Network with everyone!"

Stop.

Here's what actually works in 2025:

1. Quality AND Quantity
My client did quality & quantity for 3-4 weeks:
- Got 3-5 technical interviews weekly.
- Multiple high offers.
- Doubled his salary in 2 months.

2. Strategic networking > Mass connecting
One well-placed conversation is worth 500 random connections.

3. Confidence > Skills
Engineers with half your experience are getting paid more because they can articulate their value.

The job search game has changed.

Stop grinding LeetCode 24/7 and start learning how to position yourself.

Want to get 3-5 technical interviews every week?

Comment "PLAYBOOK" below and I will send you my Senior Job Search Playbook."""



trash_post3 = """It only takes 6 weeks to change your life.
Here's how I landed a $160,000 software role in 42 days:

Step 1: Optimize your LinkedIn profile. 
→ Include keywords to make your profile relevant to the role you want. 
(It took me 2 full days, but afterwards, I had 15x as many recruiter DMs.)

Step 2: Start Engaging
→ Post 3x a week and leave 5+ valuable comments on other posts.
(Find posts from creators that industry recruiters might follow.)

Step 3: Persistently Follow Up
→ Recruiters are busy people, and they appreciate follow ups and reminders.
(I follow up 3 times before giving up.)

Step 4: Prepare like crazy
→ For each interview, I spend 5-10 hours researching and preparing.
(The more interviews you prepare for, the faster you get at it)

Step 5: Stay Consistent
→ Continue improving your profile and staying active on LinkedIn.
(Results take time. The most important thing is not to skip days.)

After 42 days of this "passive" job search strategy, I landed an offer:

A 3-level title promotion + $160,000 compensation package.

Want the exact process in detail? 

I built a guide and linked it in the comments."""



trash_post4 = """Feels like there are 5 camps of people. 👇🏼

1️⃣ AI is everything. Software engineering is dead. Look at my demo where I just vibe-coded a salesforce clone and made $2 million last month. 🤑

2️⃣ AI is helping me do things I never could before. I’m a PM or an EM or a Sales leader who dove deep into Cursor or Windsurf and built a tool to solve a very real problem my engineering team had no time for. I’m learning, and I’m building – this is awesome. 🚀

3️⃣ Ai is nice, helps me tackle boilerplate stuff. Copilot is handy and saves me a few minutes here and there. It’s nice, but nothing life-changing. 🙂

4️⃣ AI, what AI? I keep hearing people vibe-coding up whole apps, but I tried it once last year and just walked away frustrated. 😵‍💫

5️⃣ AI is a fad. It’s the new crypto. It’s worse than a drunk junior dev, and in two years me and the other senior devs who kept our heads are going to be the only ones left who know how things work and can fix the mess all these vibe-coded prototypes created. 😤

Where do you land and why?
Can you guess where I’m at currently? See ya in the comments!"""



trash_post5 = """I’ve been thinking about complexity theory lately, and Notes on Complexity by Neil Theise helped me dive deeper into the topic.

At its core, complexity theory studies how large-scale patterns emerge from small, local interactions - no top-down control, just feedback, physics, adaptation, and self-organization.

One key concept that clarifies the theory is quenched disorder: randomness that gets “frozen in,” like imperfections in a crystal structure. You can’t see it, but it shapes how energy moves through the system. It shows up in our lives, too:
- childhood trauma
- institutional bias
- even the structure of the internet

Here are three more takeaways from the book that shifted how I see the world:

- Scale changes how you perceive everything.
At the quantum level: more random.
At the human level: more predictable.
Both impact each other.

- Local interactions drive global behavior.
One ant finds sugar → the entire colony knows in minutes.
Why? Communication protocols. Not central command. 
It's exactly true for well-organized companies - they succeed decades after the legendary founder's departure.

- Stability emerges through negative feedback loops.
When things swing left, they eventually swing right (politics, economical bubbles). Negative feedback loops keep systems in balance for most ecosystem participants.

And maybe the most radical idea:

Mass extinctions always make way for new emergent forms. Think of it this way: without the Black Death in Europe, would there have been a Renaissance?

Collapse can create the conditions for emergence.
What’s one idea that changed the way you see the world?"""



trash_post6 = """I used to think AI-first startups were distorting economic productivity metrics.
Until I saw OnlyFans’ numbers.

Everyone’s been hyping ARR/FTE as the new “north star” for AI startups. And it's higher than before. 

Reality: it is not.

Even OpenAI - the poster child of AI innovation - pulls in ~$3M ARR/FTE in 2024. 

OnlyFans? $30M ARR/FTE.

That’s 10x higher. From a platform that doesn’t even sell software.

Sure, AI disrupters will get more efficient over the next decade…

But so will everyone else. Especially incumbents with capital and internal space for automations (just some of them who will be able to transform the orgs). Microsoft already understands this and announced last week that it would lay off 3% of its staff due to "optimizations".

Before we jump on the next AI metric bandwagon, maybe pause and ask:
Has something really changed? Or is it just a hype?

P.S. Which metric do you think actually shows that AI is changing the way companies are created & scaled?"""
