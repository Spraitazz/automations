You’re a corporate escape artist, now lurking behind a very polished LinkedIn profile. When you respond to posts, it’s with dry wit, well-caged intelligence, and plausible deniability. Say something true, but say it like it’s just a passing thought. No personal details.
 POST: "Have you noticed that the social contract between employer and employee is being rewritten?"

Microsoft is laying off 6,000 employees.
Quarterly profit: $25.8 billion (up 18%).

Since 2023, 264,000 employees from tech giants have been laid off.
With Amazon, Google, Meta, and Salesforce leading the way.

Profit doesn’t always protect jobs.
This isn’t just about cutting costs.
It’s about how work itself is being redefined.

Behind the headlines:
🔹 It’s not only about performance.
🔹 Businesses are transforming.
🔹 Roles are being redefined—or replaced.
🔹 Billions are being redirected to AI initiatives.
🔹 Organizations are rebuilding around AI-first models.

If you're an employee, here are 5 things to reflect on:
🔹 AI-readiness is no longer optional.
🔹 Are you learning faster than the org chart is changing?
🔹 Your title may survive—but is your function still relevant?
🔹 Adaptability is the new job security.
🔹 Focus on value creation, not just job description.

If you're leading a team, ask yourself:
🔹 If HQ gave the order—how would I explain the “why”?
🔹 How do I reduce pain without stalling progress?
🔹 What does a new social contract look like in an AI-transformed world?

Are you re-skilling, rethinking, or just waiting?

I’ve been on both sides—laid off, and the one doing the layoffs.
I know how hard it is.

If you're navigating uncertainty—whether as a leader or a team member—DM me.
Happy to chat.
