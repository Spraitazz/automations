 POST: Future of Tech. (originally posted on r/devops)

The title is a little bit bold but nevertheless it is what is concerning me and many others for a while. I love this community, this is where I started using Reddit so it's the place imo I should discuss this.

Never in my life I thought I'd be thinking "shall I quit tech?", "is it a viable career?", "is there a future in Tech?"

I see daily posts of desperation from young folks, applying for 300-400 jobs in a short matter of time to be ghosted, rejected, disrespected by companies sending AI interviewers showing how invaluable engineers are that they don't even assign a real person to conduct an interview.

I believe STEM path requires certain aptitude and resilience, and those people could have easily become something else like Doctors, Mechanics, etc. and wouldn't witness (not to this degree) never ending vicious cycle of upskilling, ageism, and layoffs.

I'm not saying doctors, and other professions have it easy, but there are many specialties such as dentistry etc that pay very well, are extremely stable and simply can never be outsourced. You go through some shit to get there but once you're there by say 35 or so, you're pretty much set for life. And with more experience you only become more valuable, unlike tech where you're on the hamster wheel of constant upskilling just to not fall behind. And even if you manage to stay relevant and up-to-date you'll still get shit from people once you're 40+ as ageism starts to hit you.

We've been lied to continuously by media, government, and big tech about shortage of talent in tech. They had their agenda to destroy tech salaries and boost their revenues and if you ask me they've achieved it successfully. Sure there is a shortage when someone is offering very low salary and requiring years of experience, but I've yet to witness shortage where adequate compensation is offered.

So the question is where do we go from here? Do we continue riding this increasingly unstable roller coaster, constantly fighting to stay relevant in an industry that seems designed to burn us out and replace us? Or do we start seriously considering alternatives that offer more stability and respect for experience? I'm genuinely curious what others in this community think, especially those who've been in tech for 10+ years. Are these concerns overblown, or are we witnessing the slow collapse of what was once considered the most promising career path of our generation?
