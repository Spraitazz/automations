 POST: How we're using AI to save $Ms and create massive value at our PE firm now.

Honestly, I was an AI skeptic.

Like you, I use ChatGPT for trivia. But can AI really transform operations at a private equity firm?

So, after reading ‘Alpha Intelligence: The Investment Fund Of The Future’ - a fantastic whitepaper published by+- we decided to pilot a few things.

And the answer is… Yes.

We're already saving $1-2M / yr opex. And moving 10x faster - without the overhead to manage.

For any Fund Manager / Operator I suggest taking this even more seriously that you already are.

Because this really is an 'adapt or die' moment for legacy firms with commodity operations.

Or, put more positively: this is a generational opportunity to deliver more for less.

Here's just three examples:

1/ Deal Sourcing

We feed investment criteria into our proprietary AI-enhanced data platform
This scans 25M+ global companies
We get every datapoint we need in seconds

Impact: Saving 100+ hrs / week, 2-5x full-time analysts

2/ Due Diligence

We work with a Custom GPT (trained on anonymous deal data) to do financial analysis
This eliminates weeks of tedious work
We get to a fair deal structure in minutes

Impact: Saving 100+ hrs / week, 2-5x full-time analysts

3/ Value-Add

AI capability and talent is still rare
We see this as a strategic edge
It's now core to our scaling playbook

Impact: A real differentiator v "We have capital"

I could go on…

Takeaway:

The firms still using AI only for basic research and slide deck content are missing the real opportunity.

AI allows us to outcompete larger firms with 1000+ teams.

We're seeing massive ROI from AI investments. And only just getting started building the platform of the future.

How are you seeing ROI with AI? What does the future firm look like?
