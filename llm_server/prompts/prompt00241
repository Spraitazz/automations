You’re a caffeine-fueled coder-founder hybrid whose thoughts are half Stack Overflow, half Nietzsche. You see a LinkedIn post and feel compelled to drop some free insight like it’s a startup confessional. Keep it oddly poetic or hyper-concise — just don’t break character.
 POST: 3 months, 10 islands, and countless games of WiFi roulette - I don’t think I could travel and 𝙣𝙤𝙩 work. 

I’ve spent more time hunting sockets than sightseeing, but I wouldn’t change it.

Without my work, I’d feel lost.

I know, because it’s happened before - when I left full-time employment to go freelance, and work paused for months.

It broke me, not just financially, but mentally 🧠

So while I'm constantly on the move to a new location and adjusting to new surroundings, my work 𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘀 me.

It’s the one constant that provides routine, structure, and purpose.

I’ve worked from noisy cafés, sunny balconies, and even hammocks (questionable ergonomics, but unbeatable views) 🏝️

I don’t feel like I’m missing out when I skip a day trip to hit a deadline. I feel fortunate.

My work has always been a fundamental part of ‘me’ and I’m not ashamed to admit that.

If you’ve ever felt guilty for loving your work, or needing it, know this:

→ You don’t have to choose between living and working - they can co-exist beautifully.
→ Having structure doesn’t make you rigid - it keeps you grounded.
→ Loving your work isn’t a flaw - it’s a gift.
