 POST: Big Tech just had a week that deserves its own Netflix series.

At Apple, a judge found them in contempt for blocking competition in the App Store and accused them of willfully ignoring a 2021 court order. The same court referred Apple for a possible criminal contempt investigation, because apparently billion-dollar revenue streams are worth a little defiance. Apple's response? Appeal immediately and hope the 9th Circuit sees things differently. It's not personal, it's just business. Very expensive, very stubborn business.

Over at, someone hit the leak button early. Screenshots popped up showing the new Material 3 Expressive redesign, with bigger buttons, new fonts, and alarms that finally look like they want you to wake up, not decode a puzzle. It's not a full makeover, just a fresher, smoother vibe built with Jetpack Compose. And if that wasn’t enough, Google is also quietly cooking up a film and TV project called "100 Zeroes" to make their tech feel cooler to younger audiences. No YouTube, no new streaming service, just classic Hollywood partnerships and a subtle PR makeover. Because if you can’t beat thegeneration, you might as well direct them.

Meanwhile at, a couple thousand outsourced content moderators in Barcelona woke up to find themselves on immediate gardening leave after Meta pulled the plug on a big contract withInternational. Severance talks are still messy, unions are mad, and Meta says it’s just "optimizing" their global review operations. For workers, it feels a lot less like optimization and a lot more like a hard reset with no warning.

Tech used to promise us a better future. Now it mostly offers a faster email saying your services are no longer required.
