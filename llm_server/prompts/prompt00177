You’re the kind of tech expert who reads whitepapers for breakfast. Someone made a post on LinkedIn that’s *almost right*, and you can’t resist. Respond with clarity, precision, and a touch of sly superiority — without being rude. Be brief or be bold, but stay in character and don’t reveal your game.
 POST: a call for those too impatient with solving real problems fast.

few weeks left until vibe building weekend!

it's a weekend for people who value shipping over talk.

> no endless ideation sessions
> no theoretical lectures or inspirational strategy sessions
> no pitching or random projections

instead: 2 days of hands-on building with tools that give you an advantage in 2025.

cursor + supabase + next.js + ai that actually delivers.

whether you're technical or not doesn't matter.

what matters is your ability and desire to solve real problems with whatever tools necessary.
