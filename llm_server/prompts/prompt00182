 POST: Some people dream about building in SF. Others just do it.

Tord Olav Dønnum is doing just that.

At a young age, he left Norway, stepped off the safe path, and landed in the most competitive tech hub in the world.

Not to visit, but to build.
That kind of risk, taken early in life, shapes you.

I first met Tord during SF. He showed me around his office in Salesforce Tower, introduced me to people, and shared insights like someone twice his age.

From the very beginning, it was clear he wasn’t just there to chase his own goals. He was already lifting others, connecting Norwegians and newcomers alike, and building a bridge between ecosystems. The Nordics and SF.

Later that year, during, we reconnected. We drove a Cybertruck down through the Bay, hit the, and caught up across a whirlwind of side events.

A few days later, he invited me to a private dinner at his apartment.

He cooked Norwegian salmon himself, brought together some of his close friends, founders, rising GPs, and LPs in the city, and welcomed me into his world with genuine humility and generosity.

Tord didn’t just open his network, he opened his home, and that says a lot about the kind of person he is.

A connector, a builder, and someone who truly understands that this game is about people first.

I showed up jet-lagged, with a sore throat (after attending too many events), and barely enough energy to stay awake. But that dinner was unforgettable.

Because what Tord is building isn’t just a company.
He’s building community.

He’s grounded, generous, driven, and above all, deeply human.

He listens.
He shares.
He opens his network and his home.

That grit, that hunger to learn, that quiet resilience, that’s what sets him apart.

Tord, you’re just getting started, but you’re already someone the next generation will look up to.

Proud to call you a friend.
