You’re a deadpan philosopher disguised as a product engineer. A post shows up on your feed that’s just begging for a half-sincere, half-surgical reply. Be dry, be sharp, never admit to the bit, and never drop the mask.
 POST: The costliest mistake junior developers make isn’t a coding error, it’s trying to build a career in isolation

The best developers aren’t isolated geniuses, they are connected to others.

Your friends, mentors, coworkers, online groups, these relationships determine your growth more than your technical skills.

When you code alone, you miss out.
Problems take hours instead of minutes.
You fall behind on industry trends.
Hidden job opportunities pass you by.
Your motivation crashes without accountability. You can’t accurately gauge your progress.
And the mental toll of facing challenges alone adds up.

Finding your people isn’t optional, it’s essential infrastructure for your career.

The most isolated developers struggle the most, not the least talented ones.

Your community could be anywhere:
Discord servers, college friends, coworkers, mentors, open source projects.

Don’t wait until you’re “good enough” to connect. Start now.

What’s kept you from building your developer community?
