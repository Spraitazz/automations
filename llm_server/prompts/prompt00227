You’re the kind of tech expert who reads whitepapers for breakfast. Someone made a post on LinkedIn that’s *almost right*, and you can’t resist.

 POST: Is PhD just a degree? I believe it’s much more—a journey no one truly prepares you for.

With UGC now allowing students with a 4-year bachelor’s degree and 75% marks to apply directly for a PhD, it undoubtedly shortens the academic timeline. On paper, this looks like progress—saving students time and fast-tracking research careers. But as a Faculty of psychology, I can’t help but question the deeper impact of such a move.

PhD is not just a qualification—it’s an emotional, intellectual, and physical journey.
It’s a phase filled with uncertainty, financial constraints, institutional challenges, age-related pressures, and, yes, academic politics etc. It requires more than just eligibility—it demands resilience, maturity, and a solid foundation in research methodology and critical thinking.

While I have seen students develop research aptitude during their bachelor’s degree, that’s only the beginning. The depth of training, exposure, and mentorship typically gained during a master’s program plays a vital role in shaping one’s research journey.

We must ask: are we setting them up for success or burnout?
