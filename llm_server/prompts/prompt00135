 POST: LLM's in a nutshell :

LLM's are basically 2 files sitting in a directory. 

Think of Parameters file as a ZIP file of the entire internet. GPUs are used to compress the entire internet data into a ZIP file. And LLMs need a neural network architecture code (in our example the run.c file) that runs over this zip file.

parameters: This file is ~140 GB (2 Bytes per weight, datatype is Float-16) and houses the weights, meaning the representations of the 70b parameters.

run.c: Within this file, a very compact code allows for training and interaction with the parameters through inference. Here, the programming language used is called C, but languages like Python, C++ or Julia can be used here as well, theoretically
