Absolutely, a full ground plane is indeed the optimal solution for minimizing return path impedance and reducing EMI. Ground traces, while sometimes necessary for specific connections, can introduce unwanted loops and increase loop area, leading to potential EMI issues. The strategic placement of Vias directly under GND pads ensures a direct and low-impedance connection, which is crucial for signal integrity and EMC compliance.

When routing, itâ€™s important to consider the overall PCB design, ensuring that ground planes are utilized effectively to
