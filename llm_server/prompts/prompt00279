 POST: PSA for "top performers" out there… 

Being #1 out of 5 reps…
or "top 3" in a 12-person org…
doesn’t actually mean you’re elite.

It means you were a big fish in a very small pond.

True top performers don’t just win small games.

They win when the pond gets bigger:

100+ reps.
Global competition.
Real quotas.
Real pressure.

The bigger the pond...

 The sharper your skills need to be.
 The faster your weaknesses get exposed.
 The smaller your excuses sound.

New levels expose old lies.

If you REALLY want to scale your career,
stop bragging about beating 10 people.

Go put yourself in a room where EVERYONE is better than you.

Then win there.

That’s when it actually counts.
