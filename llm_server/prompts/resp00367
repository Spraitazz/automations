Absolutely â€” "start badly" is the antidote to the paralysis of perfectionism.

At Diedai, we've learned that the first version is rarely the right version â€” but it's the only way to get to the right one. That messy first draft, that half-baked prototype, that awkward MVP? That's where the real learning begins.

You donâ€™t need to wait for the perfect idea, the perfect team, or the perfect moment. You just need to start â€” and then iterate.

Thanks for sharing this â€” it's a reminder that momentum is built, not found. ðŸš€
