 POST: The GDPR is alright. Not brilliant. Not terrible. 'Alright'.

But I just saw someone declare it "poetry."

Look, it's improved data protection practices across Europe. It's given regulators actual teeth (that they don't use, but that's another story). And yes, it's made companies take a bit privacy more seriously.

But honestly, if the GDPR is your idea of poetry, I'd politely suggest you broaden your reading list.

The GDPR is a regulatory framework. A decent one. With some good principles and some genuine flaws.

But let's not idolise it.

When we stop treating it like it's scripture, we can actually have a useful conversation about making it better.

Otherwise we're just kidding ourselves.
