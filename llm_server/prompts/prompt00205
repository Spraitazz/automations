 POST: I silently groaned when - for the second year in a row - my oldest’s teacher announced her pregnancy at back to school night.

I am a fierce advocate for working parents and paid parental leave (which few school systems offer beyond accrued sick days 👎 )

*AND*

When your own kid has a substitute for three months out of the school year TWO years in a row - and they’re only in 2nd grade - it’s hard not to have mixed feelings.

While I was thrilled for his teacher, I found myself frustrated that we’ve designed and continue to adhere to a rigid staffing structure where the majority of our kid’s learning hinges on the presence of ONE specific person from September to June.

We rely on one teacher to do all the things:
📗 Deliver the majority of instruction
📘 Be the sole source of knowledge on a full class of students
📕 Create a major coverage plan without specialized support (and still teach 25 second graders!)
📙 Transition all their knowledge to a leave replacement without much, if any, overlap
📘 Return to the classroom without an onramp and assume full responsibility their first day back
📗 Limit sick time upon returning (do you know how often kids get sick at daycare? 🫠)

This is a heavy burden for one person to bear and a massive risk for a school system’s student learning goals.

In a profession where women make up 75% of the workforce, we need a more systemic and intentional approach to leave planning than one HR leader’s tongue-in-cheek suggestion to me that “teachers should just plan their babies around summer vacation.” 🙄

We can do better,
Leaders.

Step 1️⃣ - Offer at least 12 weeks paid parental leave
Step 2️⃣ - Design for shared responsibility not one person shouldering the burden
