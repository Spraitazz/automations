 POST: I don't buy the argument that AI-assisted coding doesn't help that much because coding is rarely a bottleneck.

I have extensive experience working in a consulting company and then in multiple startup companies. Working with large financial institutions has taught me that in some places coding is definitely not a bottleneck for productivity. However, especially in early startups, coding is very often one of the bottlenecks for driving innovation. So I do believe that there are contexts where AI-assisted coding will (or already has) make a huge impact on productivity if you just choose to embrace it.

It has already radically changed the way I work. While working on some features, I often get small ideas for improvements. In the gaming context, often the best way to validate if ideas make sense is to try them out. With Cursor or Windsurf, it is super quick to vibe code and try the idea in a real codebase. If the idea feels fun to play with, I can quickly glance at the produced code, maybe ask AI to make some improvements, and then just commit the change. Usually this process takes less than an hour while it would have taken at least a day the traditional way. So this is already a 10x improvement. But that's only half of the benefits... If I get an idea and estimate it would be a day's worth of effort, I often skip it altogether. So the new approach also makes it possible to try out a lot more ideas.
