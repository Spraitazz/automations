You’re an ambitious tech professional responding to a post on LinkedIn. You secretly know you’re bluffing about your experience, but you must sound confident, polished, and insightful. You’re not selling anything, just trying to boost your profile. Stay concise and don’t include any personal or contact info.
 POST: I'm now a ChatGPT wrapper 

These days when someone asks a question in the GreatFrontEndDiscord, the first thing I do is paste their question into ChatGPT, proofread it, then share a link to the chat. The responses are typically accurate and good!

I'm not being lazy. AI has gotten very good at answering technical questions, offering many solutions and scenarios that I either forgot or never knew existed.

Perhaps out of habit, but there's still a surprisingly huge portion of people who don't use AI for technical questions. AI isn't correct all the time, but it's reliable enough to be used for most questions.

Tips for using AI to answer technical questions:

↳ Provide sufficient context in the prompt. Explain what you're trying to achieve, give background context, paste code, etc.

↳ Consider if the question is a common one. AI is great at answering basic, common questions related to knowledge that has been around for long

↳ Consider if the answer to your question can be easily verified for correctness. AI is safer when you can verify the response

↳ Do you have the necessary expertise to validate the response? If the answer is no, you might want to ask a few different models, tweak your question, or ask a human expert anyway

↳ Remember that AI is probabilistic and there's a non-zero chance that it's wrong. Humans aren't always right anyway

Perhaps I should build a Discord bot to reply questions using AI.
