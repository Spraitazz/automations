#comedowneffect or why I'm not too excited about achievements

Recently, we've submitted a huge grant. Our team had been sprinting for weeks, long nights, tight deadlines. And thenâ€¦ silence. Instead of a celebration, many of us felt flat. Case is closed, let's move on.

Honestly, this feeling is so natural for me and my co-founders that the team jokes that we're a bit of robots ðŸ˜„

But there is nothing unnatural about it. It's called the comedown effect.

Itâ€™s what happens when your brainâ€™s been chasing a goal for so long, and then suddenly - thereâ€™s nothing left to chase. The dopamine drops. You donâ€™t feel joy.

Itâ€™s common after big wins: graduation from the program, product launches, personal milestones. And unless you expect it, it can catch you off guard.

What helps me:

- Expecting the comedown. Itâ€™s normal.
- Celebrating effort, not just outcomes.
- Setting a new goal before you cross the finish line.

At Turing College, weâ€™re always building something ambitious, so I always aim for a balanced stoic approach to wins and losses.

If youâ€™re building something, just a reminder: reaching the top is only half the game. The other half is what comes after.
