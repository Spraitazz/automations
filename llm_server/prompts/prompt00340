I’ve worked in teams that enforced 70% test coverage rule. on paper it sounds like a solid engineering practice.

in practice it led to some of the worst tests I’ve seen.

private methods were tested directly, a simple refactoring would break many tests. developers wrote tests not to validate behavior, but to increase the coverage number.

entire features were “tested” just by visiting the functions and calling it done.

it ended up with a false sense of security. tests didn’t document behavior, they documented implementation.

test coverage should never be a goal by itself. quality over quantity.<|im_end|>
