“A system that cannot be interpreted cannot be governed.”
And without interpretability, liability becomes a game of chance.

In Part III of the series “Why Should AI Governance Professionals & Tech Lawyers Care About AI Safety?”,draws a critical distinction between interpretability and explainability, and shows why that line matters more than ever.

Here’s the core difference:

Explainability is post-hoc: a story we construct after the model acts.

Interpretability is embedded: a direct understanding of why the model made a decision, rooted in its internal logic.

Explainability = generating a narrative about what the model might have done.

Interpretability = understanding what the model actually did.

- Explainability might help you rationalise an outcome.
- Interpretability helps you intervene before something breaks.

Under the EU AI Act, high-risk systems must be "sufficiently transparent to enable deployers to interpret a system’s output."
That’s not a box to tick - it’s a demand for traceability, accountability, and the legal right to challenge decisions.

And as Katalina argues, interpretability isn’t a philosophical nice-to-have.
It’s the foundation of governance.

Because if we can’t understand what a system is doing, we can’t regulate it.
And if we can’t regulate it, we certainly can’t trust it.

This stuff matters.<|im_end|>
