 POST: BREAKING NEWS: OpenAI will switch from LLC to a Public Benefit Corporation.

As an investor in OpenAI, I received an email earlier this afternoon sharing the news (which is also public) that OpenAI will be taking the for-profit LLC and moving it to a Public Benefit Corporation.

In Sam Altman's letter to employees, he shared the following:

1) OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit.

2) Our for-profit LLC, which has been under the nonprofit since 2019, will transition to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)â€“a purpose-driven company structure that has to consider the interests of both shareholders and the mission.

3) The nonprofit will control and also be a large shareholder of the PBC, giving the nonprofit better resources to support many benefits.

Our mission remains the same, and the PBC will have the same mission.

I think this announcement is good news for OpenAI and society at large.

It adds some clarity to the governance structure and introduces a public-benefit component to its for-profit organization.
