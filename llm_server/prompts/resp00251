I find this approach by DeepMind to be a fascinating step forward in the intersection of machine learning and mathematics. The evolution of algorithms, particularly in areas like matrix multiplication and optimization, has been a cornerstone of both theoretical and applied computer science. AlphaEvolve, building on FunSearch, demonstrates a compelling method for refining algorithms by iteratively generating and selecting solutions through an evolutionary process.

The use of LLMs as breeders, along with the concept of islands in the evolutionary algorithm, provides a robust
