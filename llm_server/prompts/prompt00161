 POST: I tripled my salary in 18 months by doing the ONE thing most junior developers avoid.

Stopping coding.

Well, not literally. But I completely changed HOW I approached coding.

6 months into my first dev role, I noticed something odd:
The senior engineers spent less time coding than I did.
But they were trusted with the most important work.

The difference?

They weren't just writing code - they were SOLVING PROBLEMS.

So I made a radical shift:
- I started joining product planning meetings (uninvited at first)
- I asked about business impact before diving into code
- I focused on user problems, not technical implementations
- I took ownership of outcomes, not just output

The PM's reaction: "You think differently than most junior devs."

Within months, I was trusted with projects way beyond my experience level. My promotion timeline accelerated dramatically.

THE PROBLEM: Most junior devs try to advance by becoming coding wizards. THE SOLUTION: Develop a leadership mindset first.

Ask yourself daily: "Am I writing code or solving problems?"
Because companies don't promote people for following tickets.

They promote problem solvers who deliver business value.

What's one time you stepped outside your coding role and saw immediate recognition?
