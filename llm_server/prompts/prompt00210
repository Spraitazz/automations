 POST: With a short delay, I'd like to share that I've returned from my second maternity leave and begun a new adventure at Turing College! 

My journey with Turing started in 2021 when I joined their Data Science course, then continued with a Mentor role and Iâ€™m thrilled to now be part of the team as an AI Engineer ðŸ¤– .

A heartfelt thank you to the entireteam for the last 5 years â€”you played a pivotal role in my growth. Iâ€™m grateful for all the people I met and the experiences we shared.
