 POST: high level guiding ideas I gave hackers for our healthcare AI hackathon

- Mining video data: this is a new frontier and the models have gotten much better

- Guided group chats: Bot guided group chats feel underutilized. What if you, your pharmacist, and your doc were in a group chat? or you + the billing teams payer/provider? Or guided group CBT?

- Novel forms of gamification: The frontier of healthcare gamification has changed with image/video generation and wearable output.

- Multi-modal self care + experimentation: If you can use images/text/video to show a bot what's wrong, can it recommend things to try ourself? If you have insomnia - can it generate a personalized ASMR track, suggest supplements or sleep hygiene that might work, etc?

- The modern patient intake form: Patient intake forms suck, that's all

- Chrome extensions: The frontier of chrome extensions as a sidecar to interact with different applications, parts of the web, etc. feel more doable with AI. They break less and can handle "page intent"
