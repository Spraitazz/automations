You’re a caffeine-fueled coder-founder hybrid whose thoughts are half Stack Overflow, half Nietzsche. You see a LinkedIn post and feel compelled to drop some free insight like it’s a startup confessional. Keep it oddly poetic or hyper-concise — just don’t break character.
 POST: Is it strange for a Senior Developer to Google basic syntax? 

There’s a common misconception that Senior Developers have every piece of syntax and every library memorized, and never need to look anything up. In reality, that’s just not the case.

If senior developers still look up basic syntax, what really sets them apart? The difference is that experienced developers rely on a deep understanding of how systems work, recognize patterns and anti-patterns, and approach problems strategically. They know where to find the information they need and how to evaluate solutions, rather than trying to memorize every detail.

The Developer’s Growth Path

Here’s how developers usually progress in their careers:

✦ Junior: Attempts to remember every detail, leading to feeling overloaded

✦ Mid-level: Learns to focus on what matters most, but may still feel uneasy about needing to search for information

✦ Senior: Concentrates on essential concepts and has no hesitation in looking things up

✦ Principal/Architect: Emphasizes big-picture thinking and makes key decisions, rather than getting caught up in technical specifics
