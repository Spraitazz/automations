 POST: So which is it? "The next generation of billion-dollar software companies will be built by Vibe Coders", or "Vibe Coding is only good for producing billions of security flaws". X and Linkedin are riddled with both takes, and neither are terribly useful imho.

Both have elements of truth, but while I think Danial's take of "Be careful which Vibe Coder you trust" is more nuanced, it still doesn't tell the story for me.

It's clear that Vibe Coding with v0, replit or lovable currently has *no place* in systems that need to be private and secure, but it DOES have a place in Proof of Concepts and Prototypes where you value neither of these things.

I'm loving watching founders give themselves greater conviction in their Solution when they realise they can build the first 40% of it themselves in half a day for $20 as a Proof of Concept.

I'm loving watching founders give themselves greater conviction in their Problem, Solution and ICP by polishing their PoC into the first Prototype over the space of the next 12 hours, and putting that in front of hypothesised customers for feedback (using the same $20 monthly subscription).

I'm wrangling the crossover point for when they need to hire a "real developer" to then take that Prototype feedback and turn it into an MVP that has just the skinniest of security and privacy basics.

I suspect that's when you're expecting to take payment. It's a sliding window here, and there's a lot of risk factors that go into this decision being earlier or later, but for me it's currently "first revenues" as the crossover point.
