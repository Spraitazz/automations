 POST: Here's something I vibe coded the other day using Vercel's V0 and a spreadsheet and it blew my mind ðŸ¤¯. 

This is a super valuable cost calculation resource that we will use atto drive more pipeline â€“ fast. It's fully interactive and can take user inputs and produce a detailed report of potential costs for in-house tax teams.

And it was all generated by doing some creative prompting and guiding the tool to deliver EXACTLY what I want (and it doesn't complain that it's too difficult or it will take too long to make... ðŸ™ƒ).

Endless possibilities! ðŸ™Œ

To be fair, I wanted to make something like this for a while but knew that asking my engineers to work on something like this would not fly. Takes too long, other priorities etc.

But now I can build and test whatever crazy growth/product idea I have in just a few prompts. Most important is to have a good reference point: an idea, dataset, sample UI, spreadsheets, lists of points.

It's that simple.

I've always been excited by code and played with it regularly but hated how long it takes to build something from scratch to be able to test it with users. It just took too long to learn the syntax and was bored out of my mind trying to debug basic errors.

Very excited that it's no longer required for early explorations and growth experiments like this. More room for creativity!
