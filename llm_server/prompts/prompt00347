If I had to come up with a winning startup idea in 2025, this is exactly how I’d do it:

1. I’d start by selling before I have a product.

I’d write a cold DM, drop a landing page, or do a LinkedIn post with a fake offer and track replies.

If nobody bites, it wasn’t a good idea.

Quick offer prompt: “We’re onboarding early customers for a tool that auto-identifies churn-risk accounts using billing + usage data. Thought it could be useful for you guys at (company name) since you’re (add context).”

2. I’d find buyers first. Then build backwards.

I’d set up 25 Zooms with people I know in 1 niche (e.g. outbound consultants, Notion service providers, RevOps teams in PLG SaaS).

I’d ask: “What are you duct-taping together right now? What’s annoying and repetitive?”

Then I’d literally write down the manual workflows they hate - and see which ones are easiest to automate.

3. I’d only chase pain with money behind it.

I don’t care about “cool problems.” I want “shut up and take my card” problems.

Specifically:

• A) Is it tied to revenue or retention?
• B) Is it recurring (daily/weekly pain)?
• C) Are they already solving it manually or hiring around it?

The problem that costs money, time, and headcount - that’s the one I’d build for.

The more painful it is, the less I have to “market” it.

4. I’d test the offer, not the product.

Before building anything, I’d ship 3 positioning angles:

• ROI: “Make $X more from current leads”
• Risk: “Flag customers likely to churn before it’s too late”
• Identity: “Built for RevOps leads inside product-led teams”

Whichever one pulls DMs or signups fastest → that’s the go-to-market messaging.

Takeaway:

The idea doesn’t need to be clever. It needs to sell.

Founders waste months polishing products no one asked for.

I’d rather close 3 fake deals in a week than launch on with a tool no one needs.

Because in 2025, startup ideas aren’t found.

They’re sold into existence.
