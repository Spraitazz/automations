It is indeed a complex issue that requires careful analysis of grid dynamics and control mechanisms. The recent blackout in Spain and Portugal highlights the evolving challenges faced by modern grids as they integrate higher proportions of variable renewable energy sources.

Your observations regarding the importance of dynamic control rather than simply blaming solar PV are spot on. The amplification of inter-area oscillations leading to a cascading failure underscores the need for advanced grid management solutions, particularly in regions heavily reliant on renewables. The role of smart inverters in mitig
