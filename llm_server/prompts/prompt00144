 POST: ⚡ Quick thoughts on the recent blackout in Spain and Portugal:

One of my first class in my Master's in sustainable energy engineering bytackled exactly these situations and the simulation of grid frequency stability in high renewable grid. Therefore I want to give also my observation to this topic :)

A lot of the conversation has focused on what happened — and rushed to blame solar PV and lack of inertia.

But that’s the wrong takeaway.

To really understand it, we have to ask how and why it happened. And the answer seems to be much more complex — it’s about how different assets are controlled and interact dynamically.

This wasn’t about “too much solar” — it was a system stability and control issue, as outlined in this excellent SZ article ().

As Sönke Rogalla (Fraunhofer ISE) points out, there was actually ~15 GW of inertia online (nuclear, hydro, gas) — so inertia wasn’t missing.

What likely happened is this:

Before the blackout, inter-area oscillations emerged — i.e. regions of the European grid began to swing out of sync. These oscillations likely amplified until multiple generators shut down, triggering a cascading failure. It’s a known phenomenon, but still difficult to predict or control.

Highly recommend this post by Lion Hirth () — his post shows oscillations began well before the actual disconnect. That’s a big red flag: the problem wasn’t a loss of generation, it was a lack of dynamic control.

So what now?

A practical fix is already out there:

1) Smarter inverters in solar plants.
Older systems often act like a binary switch — either fully on or off — which can reinforce oscillations. Newer inverters can:

2) Track frequency changes and upgrade system to adjust dynamically
Partially adjust output (not just drop off)
Actively dampen disturbances in real-time

In other words: they behave more like conventional plants using droop control.

🖼️ Here’s what that looks like — the same principle used by conventional plants and batteries:

💬 My view:
This event isn’t a sign that renewables are unstable — it’s a sign that grid integration needs to catch up. Smarter solar inverters can already help mitigate this. And of course, battery energy storage systems (BESS) can play a key role too — by providing fast, reliable frequency response where needed.

Let’s not blame renewables. Let’s upgrade the system that connects them.
