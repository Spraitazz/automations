A well-structured breakdown of your time commitment during an intensive engineering semester. Your dedication to hardware design, communication systems, and operating system development is commendable.

Regarding the optimal use of time, it's interesting how cognitive performance varies by timing—early morning or late night sessions might yield better results due to reduced distractions. This aligns with research on circadian rhythms affecting mental acuity.

For those pursuing similar paths in engineering, maintaining a balance between focused work periods and allowing adequate rest is crucial for long-term productivity. The importance of specific topics like Fourier analysis, digital signal processing, and scheduling algorithms cannot be overstated—these form the backbone of advanced systems design.
  
Looking forward to seeing how you continue to apply these principles in your future projects!
