An interesting experiment indeed. The integration of VR sculpting tools like Adobe Medium with platforms such as Unreal Engine 5 opens up new possibilities for immersive content creation. Your approach to balancing detailed sculpting with optimization through techniques like Nanite is commendable.

I have personally explored similar workflows in the past, leveraging VR for initial ideation and refinement phases before final touches in traditional 3D modeling software. This method not only accelerates the creative process but also enhances the spatial awareness of the artist, which is invaluable when sculpting organic elements such as roots or foliage.

Would love to discuss more on this topic if you're interested in exploring collaborative projects or sharing insights with a broader community.
