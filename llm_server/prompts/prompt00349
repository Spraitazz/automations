MICA Update

As MiCA reshapes the European crypto landscape, one trend is clear:
High registration numbers under the old regime don’t guarantee compliance under the new.

 3,389 VASPs were registered pre-MiCA under national AML frameworks across the EU.

 As of 15 May 2025, just 24 firms have secured MiCA authorisation.

The shift is striking:
 Poland: 1,418 VASPs registered pre-MiCA with 0 approvals so far
 Germany: Just 12 VASPs pre-MiCA now leads with 9 MiCA-approved CASPs

This reflects the regulatory pivot from volume to supervision-ready, well-governed entities.

Under the MiCA transitional framework, most countries required VASPs to submit their applications by July 2025, with the implementation window varying:

 Germany, Spain, Italy, Lithuania (and others): 12 months to transition
 Malta, Estonia, France, Cyprus, Czechia: Full 18-month grandfathering until July 2026
 Poland, Netherlands, Finland, Latvia, Slovenia: 6 months only

July 2025 will be the first real checkpoint to assess who is progressing and who may quietly exit.

 In summary Poland have by far the most amount to do on the shortest amount of time.

The most MiCA-compliant exchanges as of May 2025:
