🔒 EDR tools aren’t just being bypassed — they’re getting laughed at.

A ransomware operator just called out their reality:
Tools like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint aren’t barriers — they’re jokes.
(Assuming “LOL” here literally means laughing out loud)

And honestly... we did this to ourselves:
⚙️ Bloated, inconsistent configurations
😵‍ Terrible UX hiding critical features
🛠️ Half-baked deployments drowning in tech debt
👥 Teams stretched too thin, drowning in endless prioritized lists... with no action

At the end of the day, attackers aren’t bypassing our tools.
They’re bypassing our execution.

🧹 Basic hygiene
🛡️ Actual fixes
🚀 Ruthless simplification
That's the real "advanced security" most orgs need.
