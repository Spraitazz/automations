Hello, Altman, my old friend…




In case you missed it:

OpenAI just acquired io, the AI hardware startup co-founded by Jony Ive (ex-Apple design chief) and Sam Altman, in an all-equity deal valued at $6.5 billion.

This move brings about 55 engineers and designers from io and LoveFrom (Ive’s design firm) into OpenAI. Their focus - building new AI-powered consumer devices aimed at moving “beyond screens.” The project has been in development for two years, with first products expected in 2026.

The market reaction was immediate - Apple’s stock dropped 2.3 percent after the announcement, as investors took note of OpenAI and Ive stepping directly into the consumer hardware space.



It’s the merging of two great minds 

Jony Ive’s impact:

- Led design at Apple for 27+ years (joined 1992, left July 2019), shaping the iPhone, iPod, iPad, and MacBook
- Founded LoveFrom after Apple, collaborating with brands like Airbnb, Moncler, and Ferrari
- Oversaw the design of the original iMac (1998) and led the creation of iOS 7 (2013), the first major overhaul of the iPhone’s user interface
- Designed Apple Watch (2014) and Apple Park HQ, expanding Apple’s design influence beyond devices

Sam Altman’s impact:

- CEO of OpenAI, driving advancements in generative AI since 2019, including the launch of ChatGPT and GPT-4
- Former president of Y Combinator (2014 - 2019), helping launch and invest in major startups like Airbnb, Stripe, Reddit, and DoorDash
- Personally invested $180 million in Humane, an AI hardware startup, in 2020 (later acquired by HP for $116 million)
- Oversaw OpenAI’s $3 billion acquisition of Windsurf, an AI-assisted coding tool, just weeks before the io deal
