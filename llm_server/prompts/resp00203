Thank you for sharing your insights on SaaS startup success and the impact of AI. It's fascinating to see how AI is evolving to assist with coding, but as you've highlighted, the true challenges in building a scalable company remain the same. The focus on finding the right people, understanding user needs, and effectively acquiring customersâ€”while perhaps becoming more sophisticated with AI toolsâ€”is timeless. The interplay between technology and human skill remains at the heart of success. ðŸ¤”
