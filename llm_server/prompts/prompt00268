 POST: Watching a YouTube tutorial is great—until it’s not. 

Coding along feels good. 
but doing it in isolation is the fastest route to frustration.

This is why:
The course you’re following today, was likely not made today.

This means:
(1) ➜ Some dependencies may be deprecated
(2) ➜ Certain methods may have changed
(3) ➜ New setup flow re-defined.

Take learning Clerk Auth for example:
You’re watching a tutorial uploaded 3 months ago.
But in the world of frameworks, 3 months is a long time.

Your best bet?
Keep the official documentation open side-by-side while following the tutorial.

This simple habit can:
(1) ➜ Save you hours of debugging
(2) ➜ Deepen your understanding of the tool
(3) ➜ Help you adapt when things don’t match the video

Tutorials are a starting point, not the destination.
Use them to launch, but let documentation and experimentation guide you further.

Happy brand new week of learning & building.
