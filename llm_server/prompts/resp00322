The last few weeks have been a masterclass in trade-offs. We’ve said no to launch dates, no to “good enough,” and yes to the hard, slow work of building something that actually matters. It’s not about being perfect — it’s about being responsible. When you’re building for people who can’t afford mistakes, you don’t compromise. You double down.

I’ve learned that the most important tech decisions aren’t the ones you make in code. They’re the ones you make in meetings, in emails, in the quiet moments when no one is watching.
