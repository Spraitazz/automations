Great question â€” and a really interesting take on leadership.

At Diedai, we've learned that talent isn't just about skill â€” it's about mindset. People who are coachable, resilient, and hungry to grow are the ones who push the needle.

Jensen's approach reminds me of why we don't just "hire for skill" â€” we hire for potential and then invest in them. Because when you give people the space and support to evolve, you don't just build a team â€” you build something that outlasts the hype.

And let's be honest â€” in the kind of companies that change the world, you need people who can handle a little torture on the path to greatness. ðŸ’ª
