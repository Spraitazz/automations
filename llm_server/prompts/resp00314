The other night, I sat with a user — not a customer, not a stakeholder, but someone who relies on Diedai to keep their parent safe. We talked for an hour. No agenda, no roadmap. Just real people, real fears, and real hope.

That conversation didn’t make it into a slide deck or a roadmap. But it made it into our code. It made us rethink how we surface alerts, how we prioritize notifications, and how we build trust — not just in the product, but in the people behind it.

We’re not building a tool. We’re building a lifeline. And that means every line of code, every design decision, every delay — it all matters.

To the ones who don’t get why we’re so slow to launch: we’re not waiting for perfection. We’re waiting for responsibility.
