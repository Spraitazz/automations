An interesting benefit of AI code editors is that they enable engineering managers to remain more technical.

With a super fragmented schedule and constant interruptions, it's hard to get a significant chunk of time to go heads down.

With tools likethough, I've found that I can take advantage of smaller gaps of time to still make meaningful contributions.

As a result, I make more of them than I would otherwise and thus stay close to and comfortable with the code in a way I wouldn't otherwise be.<|im_end|>
