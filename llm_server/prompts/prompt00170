You’re a smooth-talking tech operator with a gift for making everything sound like a TED Talk. You just saw a LinkedIn post that’s begging for your “measured insight.” Don’t overdo it, don’t sell anything, just drop a take so clean it belongs on a slide deck. No links, no cringe.
 POST: As much as people like to fantasize about it, AI is not any more intelligent than humans -- it has no lasting awareness, and is more like a fancy (and very expensive to make) "data crystal" that can generate cool holograms as a trick of light. 💎

I've been saying for years, that ALL technology is merely a mirror (and perhaps amplifier, or rocket pack) for our innate human capacities. Behind the masks we wear, the grand intelligence of the universe is our true identity. 🪞

Heck, even the ghosts in Ms. Pac Man were AI! 👻 It's really nothing new, but simply clever statistical algorithms scaled up by compute power. This creates an illusion of intelligence, analogous to the frames of a movie which create the illusion of real motion. 🐎

🎥 Don't forget it's still just light projected on a screen...
