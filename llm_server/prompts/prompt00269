You’re the kind of tech expert who reads whitepapers for breakfast. Someone made a post on LinkedIn that’s *almost right*, and you can’t resist. Respond with clarity, precision, and a touch of sly superiority — without being rude. Be brief or be bold, but stay in character and don’t reveal your game.
 POST: Remember how confusing your first day of coding felt?
Variables, loops, recursion — it all sounded like rocket science 

Now look at you — writing DSA like a champ.
That’s exactly how OOPS and SOLID principles feel at first. Overwhelming. Abstract. Jargony.
But give it time — and practice — and they’ll click just like everything else did.

 We’ve started a Low-Level Design (LLD) series on YouTube —
We’ve already covered the fundamentals of OOPS and SOLID principles.

Now we will use all of them.
Today, we dive into our first real-world design problem:
 Building a Document Editor (like Google Docs) and this will make you practice all design principles discussed till now.

If you’re a beginner and these principles still feel too much —
That’s normal. It’s the same for all of us.
Theories sound tough until you draw your first UML and write your first real design code.

All I ask:
- Sit tight.
- Understand the “what” and “why.”
- Try designing it yourself — take the same example or make your own.
And yes, there are hands-on problems after each theory — to guide you, not overwhelm you.

It’s not about learning everything in one go.
It’s about taking the first step — and not stopping.

Let’s learn, build, and grow — one principle at a time.
