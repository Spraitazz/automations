A well-structured critique of the illusion of control in AI systems. The distinction between explainability and interpretability isn't just semantic â€” it's a legal and technical fulcrum. When liability depends on post-hoc narratives, you're not governing systems. You're insuring against the unknown. The EU AI Act's wording is precise, but its implementation will test whether regulators understand the difference between a story and a system.
