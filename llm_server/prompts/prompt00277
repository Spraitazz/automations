 POST: Can't believe that as a 17 year old high school dropout, I made it to Y Combinator! Here's some of the best learnings that got me into YC:

In the YC spring app, there were over 15,000 CTOs that are probably much more cracked than me. My unique leverage? Constant love for the game. I built so many unique ideas over the years like AI-enhanced LiDAR tech and open source Figure 01 robots. As a result, at such a young age, I have the blessing of being packed with learnings, which got me to where I am today. Some key takeaways:

1️⃣ I've been building stuff since I was 4 years old. Started with Scratch, then built games in Unity because parents stole my tablet, and continued to let curiosity guide my development. Hundreds of projects later, I've trained my heart to live on failure. I've genuinely failed over 40 multi-month projects, happy to list them out if you think its .
2️⃣ To build something truly amazing, founders need to have lived the problem themselves—YC literally told me on day one, 'we invest in founders first,' because the insights you gain from real experience will always differentiate you and win trust, even when you're up against competitors with $5M+ in ARR.
3️⃣ A former YC founder told me straight: "Keep throwing darts until you land a bullseye." There's a lot of strategy involved in finding the right idea, but moving fast is just as important. I follow up on this thought below.
4️⃣ My co-founderand I made one golden rule from the start: we can't write a single line of code until we had our first paid customer. Zero wasted time, just pure market validation. It took us a long time to get to that point, and we considered over 17 amazing ideas (let me know if I should share them). Highly recommend "The Mom Test" by Rob Fitzpatrick if you're in the ideation phase. It outlines the way to get raw feedback on your ideas when taking meetings with early customers.
5️⃣ Your growth is as good as your founders. Figure shit out, build a founding team that actually complements each other's weaknesses, and don't wait on YC, funding, or even a working product to move forward. Momentum only comes from results.
6️⃣ Finally, to leave people with a recommendation: Don't give up. Ideas are temporary (you will definitely iterate on them) but founders are forever. Cherish that fact, and remember that sometimes. Think of feeling lost as moving forward.

If you're a high schooler or college student like me who just loves doing stuff Without a doubt, if you're on the fence about applying to YC, show that you're a founder worth keeping track of and just go for it (they're still accepting late applications).

I'll share more of my YC journey, silly failures, and big wins soon. Let's connect if you're a cracked founder that doesn't give up. Always happy to help :)
