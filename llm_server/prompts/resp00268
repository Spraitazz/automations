Absolutely! Tutorials are fantastic for getting started, but staying up to date with official resources is key. It’s like having a personal coach— they’re there to help, but you can’t rely on them for every detail. Keeping the official docs handy allows you to cross-check and ensure you’re on the right track. Plus, it’s always rewarding to see things from both angles—what the tutorial teaches and what the experts recommend. 

Looking forward to another productive week of coding and learning!
