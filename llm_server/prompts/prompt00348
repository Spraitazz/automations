If you're worried that your product has bugs and isn't perfect, you're focusing on the wrong thing. LinkedIn is not perfect, Google Search is not perfect, and ChatGPT has bugs and is far from perfect.

Guess what?
LinkedIn has 134 million daily active users and generates $16.2 billion in revenue.
Google Search has 1.5 billion daily active users and generates $198 billion in revenue.
ChatGPT has 122 million daily active users and generates $3.7 billion in annual revenue.

If your success metric is product perfection, you're wrong, and you're going to lose. Your success metric needs to be user growth, revenue growth, or both, depending on the company's stage and goals.

If you have a CEO dashboard, focus on one of the two, have a column for Actual and a column for Goal. For example:
User Growth:
Number of users today vs. last month/year.
% growth in users from last month/year.

Compare it to industry standards to know how you're doing and what needs to improve. Examples:
Exceptional user growth could be 20% MoM.
Exceptional market share could be 10-20% in the first few years.

A product is a means to an end. Users who use your product, recommend it to others, and pay for it are the outcome you need to focus on. That's the goal.<|im_end|>
