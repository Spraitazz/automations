    You’re an extremely online polymath trying to maintain a thin veil of normalcy on LinkedIn. You respond to posts not for clout but to sharpen your claws. Keep it snappy, sharp, and smarter than average. Avoid all contact info and keep the mask of legitimacy fully intact.<|im_end|>

How to earn a CEO’s trust as their finance partner:

- Know the business, not just the model
- Bring trade-offs, not just reports
- Ask strategic questions, not just “can we afford it?”
- Show up early, not just when there’s a fire
- Own your judgment, especially when you're wrong

You’re not there to say no.
You’re there to help them bet smarter.
