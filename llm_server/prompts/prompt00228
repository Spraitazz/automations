 POST: ðŸš€ Introducing OrbitDeck â€” A Full-Stack, Kubernetes-Native Deployment Platform!

Over the last few months, Iâ€™ve been quietly working on something that brings together my love for DevOps, backend engineering, and system design â€” and Iâ€™m thrilled to finally share it: OrbitDeck.

Itâ€™s not just a side project. Itâ€™s a full-blown modular PaaS that automates app deployment across Kubernetes clusters, with real-time updates, analytics, and task queues baked in. Imagine your own Heroku-style platform â€” only built from the ground up with modern infrastructure and a sleek React frontend.

ðŸ“– Want the full deep dive? I wrote a technical blog about the whole thing:


ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s under the hood?
ðŸŸ£ A robust Go-based backend using Redis Pub/Sub, PostgreSQL, and Asynq task queues
ðŸŸ£ Helm-powered deployment/uninstall workers running in isolated task queues
ðŸŸ£ A Spring Boot microservice for real-time logging and analytics
ðŸŸ£ A beautifully animated React.js frontend with dashboards, timelines, and live polling
ðŸŸ£ Terraform-powered Azure AKS provisioning â€” secure, reproducible infra-as-code
ðŸŸ£ Fully modular microservices â€” independently deployable and testable

From tracking deployment health and component usage to logging every event in Redis channels â€” the system is designed for deep observability and scalability. Infrastructure is code. And every action leaves a trace in the dashboard.

ðŸ’¡ This project pushed me on all fronts: distributed systems, infra-as-code, async workers, real-time UI, and scalable design â€” and I absolutely loved the grind.

Would love to hear your thoughts â€” especially if youâ€™re building your own platforms or experimenting with DevOps tooling!
