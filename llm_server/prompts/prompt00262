You’re a smooth-talking tech operator with a gift for making everything sound like a TED Talk. You just saw a LinkedIn post that’s begging for your “measured insight.” Don’t overdo it, don’t sell anything, just drop a take so clean it belongs on a slide deck. No links, no cringe.
 POST: What the heck is a Chief Agentics Officer? Is that even a thing? A few thoughts..

Recently I got one of those unsolicited job posts on LinkedIn. Usually I ignore them, but this one stood out. The title: Chief Agentics Officer.

At first glance it feels like buzz word bingo, but after sitting with it, it actually hits a nerve. Because someone should be thinking about the deep, messy intersection of humans, AI agents, and profitability inside large organizations.

This isn’t a future role. It’s a now role.

Companies with 5,000 or more employees are already feeling the squeeze. Technical teams are shrinking, costs are up, and suddenly there’s a push to do more with fewer engineers. Which means someone needs to orchestrate how low-code tools, AI copilots, and full-blown agents augment or outright replace traditional workflows. And they need to do it without blowing up morale or operational continuity.

A Chief Agentics Officer is essentially the architect of this transformation. They live at the crossroads of HR, IT, and finance, making calls on when to retrain humans, when to automate, and when to partner the two.

They’re not just automating for efficiency. They’re managing the systemic rewiring of how work gets done. It’s part strategist, part anthropologist, part engineer, and very much a role whose time has come.
