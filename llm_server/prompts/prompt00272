 POST: The real reason HealthTech startups fail

The status quo always outlasts your burn. 

Many HealthTech founders think they're fighting for market share.

They're not.

They're fighting for survival against the NHS's gravitational pull toward inaction.

Not bad tech.
Not weak teams.
Not even lack of funding.

It's time. Time spent waiting for decisions.

Time lost navigating procurement.

Time wasted chasing the illusion of "momentum" when what you really need is traction.

The NHS doesn't always say no.

Many times it says "maybe later."

Which is a slower, more expensive way of saying no.

Founders confuse interest with progress.

A warm meeting. A positive pilot.

A nice quote for the deck.

But the pilot ends. Your champion leaves.

And suddenly, you're back at zero.

Except now you're six months behind, one round deeper, and twice as exposed.

NHS procurement isn't a buying process. It's a filter for risk.

Every "innovative" new tool is another operational liability.

The default option is doing nothing - because doing nothing never gets blamed as much as doing something that doesn't work and costs money.

You don't get outcompeted.

You get outlasted.

That's the real reason HealthTech startups fail.

Not because someone beat them.

Because they ran out of time before the system was ready to move.

So what can you do differently?

Stop selling like it's SaaS.

Start embedding like it's infrastructure.

Build adoption so quiet and deep, it becomes harder to turn them off than to keep them running.

Build relationships not for the next meeting, but for the next restructure.

Sell not to the most excited team, but to the one who will still be there in 18 months.

The market doesn't reward brilliance.

It rewards persistence.

And resilience.

And deep operational empathy.

That's not inspiring.

That's just how it works.

P.S. Of course there are many start-ups that fail for other reasons but this is something I see time and time again.
