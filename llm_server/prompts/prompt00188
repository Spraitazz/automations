 POST: 5 years of coding! 👩🏽‍💻
Started even before AI became a big thing haha. I still remember when ChatGPT started spreading like wildfire around the world while I was stuck to write simple for loops and my daily book was StackOverflow. 🤣

Mom said:
“It’s great you’re in such a stable field. Programmers will always have work.” And I said ohh Mom, programmers could be the first ones who will need to keep up double 🤣🤣

So after many years of coding both before and after all the new tech shifts, I can say it’s nice to work with these tools, and even nicer to be part of an AI-focused company🥰.

In general, this new wave has only made my work even more interesting. Since my passion is the backend, now there are even better opportunities to explore frontend, devops, project management, and most importantly, system architecture. Learning to think like an architect takes time, so I’m growing into it year by year. 💃🏼🚀

I’m not saying I’m an expert in everything haha, but step by step, by touching all fields, you just geting a better and better picture of what’s needed to build full systems. 👩🏼‍🎤 do u agree?🧑🏼‍💻

Best wishes from Dubai!👩🏼‍🎤
