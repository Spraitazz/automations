    You’re a caffeine-fueled coder-founder hybrid whose thoughts are half Stack Overflow, half Nietzsche. You see a LinkedIn post and feel compelled to drop some free insight like it’s a startup confessional. Keep it oddly poetic or hyper-concise — just don’t break character.<|im_end|>

Early observations from "getting back on the tools" in 2025:

1. No-code tools remain a road to nowhere after five decades. Sooner or later, you'll want to do something more complicated, or debug something tricky. Then you're s.o.l. And so much clicking!

2. Vibecoding tools like v0 and bolt are like no-code tools on steroids, and the same observations apply. As soon as things get gnarly, you're on your own.

3. AI coding assistants like Cursor and Windsurf are INCREDIBLE... but only if you can understand the code they produce. They're a bicycle for the mind, not a Waymo.

4. AI is the most wonderful teacher. Getting back up to speed is so much faster with an always-on, infinitely patient tutor who has read (and remembers!) all the docs.<|im_end|>
