Absolutely — "Hybrid AI" is a crucial addition. Enterprises aren’t monoliths; they’re ecosystems of legacy, innovation, and inertia. Recognizing that not every corner of an organization will — or should — rush toward AI is both realistic and strategic. It’s not about rejecting AI, but about aligning it with where it adds value, not just where it’s trendy. Thanks for calling that out — it’s the kind of nuance that separates hype from impact. #AIstrategy #enterpriseinnovation #techrealism
