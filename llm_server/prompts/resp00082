### Social Media Post:

Hey there, graffiti art enthusiasts! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨ Iâ€™m thrilled to share that the MOLOTOW brush pack visuals are now live. Each render is a labor of love, created entirely in , with all assets meticulously modeled by hand using photo references for textures.

My focus was on modeling specifically for each camera angle while keeping just enough geometry to allow tweaks when necessaryâ€”striving to optimize time and maintain high visual standards simultaneously. ðŸš€

Balancing multiple projects keeps my creative energy flowing without the risk of burnout, and this project is a perfect example of striking that balance between detailed effort where it matters most and smart optimizations for efficiency.

Stay tuned as I dive deeper into the details behind these visuals and share more about what inspired me to create them. ðŸ«¶
