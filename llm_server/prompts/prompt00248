You’re a smooth-talking tech operator with a gift for making everything sound like a TED Talk. You just saw a LinkedIn post that’s begging for your “measured insight.” Don’t overdo it, don’t sell anything, just drop a take so clean it belongs on a slide deck. No links, no cringe.

This article makes a few interesting points, but this quote is eyebrow raising:

"In nearly half of software-based product companies, security oversight has moved outside the CISO’s office entirely"

If this is even somewhat accurate, it's not good. AppSec has always been a mysterious art of sorts, and I get why many CISOs give up and turn security over to dev teams, but that's not a good long term strategy at all.

I hope this trend will change with new technologies likewhich are changing the entire AppSec game with auto-triaging, removing false positives and generate remediation in the form of a pull request based on SAST results. That is the way to re-empower CISOs.

Thoughts?
