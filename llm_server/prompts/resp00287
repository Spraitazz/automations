Today, I’m thrilled to share that our latest AI model has passed the most critical tests. It’s now part of Diedai’s real-time alert system.

This isn’t just an advancement in tech — it's a commitment to care for those we serve. 

When elderly users are at risk, we need more than “good enough.” We need data-driven precision and compassion combined.
We’re building not only software but empathy into our systems. This model is about much more than lines of code; it’s a lifeline.
