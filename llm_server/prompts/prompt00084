6 kilos of laptopâ€¦

I almost forgot IBM took a shot at portable computing in the 80s. Then I came across a clip of someone unboxing the PC Convertible.

Beige plastic, floppy disks, and a snap-off screen. That clip had 1986 written all over it.

This was IBMâ€™s first laptop. No operating system onboard. Just 265KB of RAM, a detachable keyboard, and nearly 6 kg. It sold for $2,000.

The screen was a monochrome LCD with a 640 by 200 resolution. Power came from nickel-cadmium batteries. Ports included serial, parallel, and an expansion connector.

But sales didnâ€™t follow. It was too heavy, hard to read in poor lighting, and lacked the ports people actually needed.

Meanwhile, Toshiba and Compaq quickly pulled ahead with lighter, more practical machines.

Still, the PC Convertible introduced features we rely on today. Battery-powered use. Sleep mode. Those 3.5 inch floppies.

It failed as a product but succeeded as a prototype for an entire category.

How about you? Ever get a chance to use one of these 6 kg laptops?
