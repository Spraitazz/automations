 POST: I tracked every hour of deep (no b.s) work during my 3rd year comp eng semester at Waterloo, totalling 478.8 hours, averaging ~37 a week. Where did all this time go?

1) 155.4 hours → hardware design (ece327)
highlight: built a full integer BERT neural network model from scratch in sverilog
- systolic arrays help you multiply big matrices fast
- layer norm is used because AI doesn't like big numbers
- gelu squishes numbers to help pattern recognition
- FPGA synthesis turns code into actual circuits

2) 110.8 hours → comm systems (ece318)
highlight: listened to ‘Espresso’ for the 118th time on an FM radio receiver that I built with my own hands
- information moves as waves
- send a message by tweaking the amplitude, frequency, or phase of a strong carrier
- ignore everything I just said and go digital
- convert analog to bits, shape waves become 0's and 1's
- use math to tune out static noise

3) 85.8 hours → operating systems (ece350)
highlight: working with 3 cracked friends to build an OS from scratch on an STM32 microcontroller
- processes are programs with their own memory space and execution stack, threads share memory space
- scheduling algorithms decide who gets how much CPU time
- fair isn't always optimal

4) 76.6 hours → analog control systems (380)
highlight: finally understanding Fourier
- nyquist plots tell you if your system will break
- stability tells you if system will freak out
- root locus shows you how system changes as you tweak knobs
- laplace transforms this messy math into simple algebra

5) 2.0 hours → greek mythology (clas 104)
- zeus is always the father

6) 48.2 hours → interview prep
- grinding leetcode

But the ultimate lesson?
Working in 2-hour undistracted chunks beats twice that amount in distracted or broken-up intervals, and working early morning (~5 am) or late night (~2 am) beats work done throughout the day.
