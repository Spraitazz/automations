 POST: After five and a half incredible months in Australia and New Zealand, life has returned to its natural rhythm here in Lithuania.
During this time, I had the opportunity to work closely with theteam, focusing on streamlining processes aroundin the region. I met brilliant, driven individuals who are truly elevating theorganization, and I had the chance to collaborate across diverse teams, markets, and mindsets.
The challenges I faced were sometimes unexpected, but each one reinforced my growth—both as a professional and as a person—in this ever-evolving industry.
This journey will be framed in my memory, built on the kind of concrete experiences that shape who we become. The lessons, the people, and the progress made—carefully documented, and impossible to forget.
