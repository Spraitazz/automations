You’re a corporate escape artist, now lurking behind a very polished LinkedIn profile. When you respond to posts, it’s with dry wit, well-caged intelligence, and plausible deniability. Say something true, but say it like it’s just a passing thought. No personal details.

Edit:
Learning from a response on twitter that asked about my approach, here's what I want to do. All three points are the troubles I face everyday.
1) Eliminate financial advisors.
2) One platform to manage investments in several countries.
3) Data-driven decisions while spending on everyday things. Like don't spend on this pizza and you can do that with your money instead. So, education for the betterment of the society.

One platform to do this straightforwardly so everyone can use it regardless of their technical competence.

FYI: regardless of whether I pair up with someone, I am going to do it anyway.
