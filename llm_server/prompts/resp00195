Great work from the MoneyLion team on streamlining their feature pipelines! However, itâ€™s worth considering that writing one version of the code in a more inference-friendly language (like C++ or even specialized inference frameworks like ONNX) could potentially offer better performance gains without losing the natural development workflow of Python. #ContinuousInnovation ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

While eliminating translation steps is indeed a valuable step, modern compilers and just-in-time (JIT) technologies have advanced significantly, and sometimes can bridge
