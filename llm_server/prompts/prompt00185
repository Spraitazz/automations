 POST: The most under-the-radar, non-obvious and exciting company in climate tech right now is a bus company. Well, sort of. 

The intercity bus travel experience hasn't changed in decades. Fasten your seatbelt 🚌, enter.

Whatanddid wasn't just swap diesel for batteries - they asked, "What if we started over?" They've built their own charging network, created their own full stack, end-to-end operating system, and they've designed a network of routes that is delighting customers 24/7/365. This year they'll deliver over 100 million zero-emission passenger kilometres that simply wouldn't exist without their fundamental rethinking of the problem. And they're just getting started.

What's unique:
-> First company in the world to take a full-stack, tech-led approach to bus travel
-> First electric-only operator in Europe
-> EmberOS is a fully integrated platform that controls everything from customer experience to operations to charging
-> Insanely obsessed with customer experience
-> Insanely obsessed about costs and operational efficiency
-> Insanely obsessed about precision and detail
-> From the early days, utilising financing structures that others only manage to achieve, or attempt, at super large scale
-> Marketing costs are basically zero - the best marketing is happy customers through word-of-mouth
-> Everything they've built today is designed to scale 10x, then 100x, at venture speed

As per Keith's words - taking a software mindset to hardware has given them a so-called “API for Atoms” moment - standardising, controlling, and programmatically interacting with the physical elements of the business. Turning real world mess into 1's and 0's.

Best service and best price rarely co-exist. Only the best of the best achieve that. But when these things converge and co-exist - magic happens. Customers see and feel the magic.

I am excitedly waiting for the day I can "Ember it" across all of Europe. And so should you. Ember converts -> When the entire digital and physical bus experience is so good, you convert from car to Ember, and don’t look back.

They are hiring, join the silent revolution:
