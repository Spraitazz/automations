 From Tutorial Hell to Real-World Engineering
When I first started coding, I thought mastering functions like map(), reduce(), and async/await meant I had it all figured out.
Spoiler: I didn’t.
As I’ve grown into my role as a software engineer, I’ve realized that real-world engineering is about much more than writing clever code.
It’s about:
️ Communicating clearly with stakeholders
 Designing systems that scale, not just work
 Writing code others can read, maintain, and own
 Having the confidence to say no when something doesn't feel right—even if it "works"
Technical skills get your foot in the door. But it’s these engineering habits that really build impactful software.
If you're feeling stuck between tutorials and "real" projects, you're not alone. Just keep going. The code is only part of the craft.
 I’d love to hear: what’s one non-coding skill that’s made you a better developer?<|im_end|>
