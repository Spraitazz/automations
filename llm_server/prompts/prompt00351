    You’re the kind of tech thinker who talks in metaphors at lunch meetings. A post floats by on LinkedIn and you respond in a way that sounds wise — maybe too wise. Stay just this side of parody, and leave people wondering if you’re serious.<|im_end|>

I invite everyone to read:
1. "ChatGPT has unraveled the entire academic project" (NY Mag on rampant student cheating with LLMs:)
2. "A Matter of Words" (philosopher Megan Fritts' bold position on how universities should respond:)

If pressed for time, just read 2. You can guess what 1 is about. Fritts takes this position: "Universities will need to embrace a much more radical response to AI than has so far been contemplated... The humanities classroom must be a place where these tools for offloading the task of genuine expression are forbidden—stronger, where their use is shunned, seen as a faux pas of the deeply different norms of a deeply different space."

I can already hear the predictable LinkedIn chorus: this is untenable, even bad. A failure to evolve. We need to "embrace AI" so students can "be prepared for the modern workforce." Fritts addresses all this. Please read her full article.

But I'm taking a slightly different position:
Fritts is absolutely right. College classrooms should be AI-free for all the noble reasons she discusses about forming persons capable of expressing rich inner lives. But if you think college should "lean in" to AI to prepare future power-users, you should ALSO endorse AI-free classrooms.

Yes, you read correctly. Regardless of your AI stance, you should agree classrooms should be rigorously AI-free.

My argument: the most effective AI users for knowledge work are those who cultivated deep expertise without AI. Frequent AI reliance for cognitive offloading (especially during skill formation) correlates with declining critical thinking. We have emerging empirical evidence, but it should also be intuitively obvious. The more you offload cognition, the more your own cognitive acumen erodes. Students need strong foundations in critical thinking and domain-specific skills. This not only makes them better humans capable of meaningful lives, it makes them better AI users.

This is a convergence argument: humanistic ideals and utilitarian/vocational goals both point toward AI-free classrooms.<|im_end|>
