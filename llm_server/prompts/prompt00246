 POST: High growth is no fun & random activity.

Okay, maybe it is a little bit, but to get over steep learning curve fast you need to back yourself up with some borrowed experience from other people, right?

There’s a lot of theories how people are learning, but what I’m particularly interested lately is how people learn inside organizations.

To be even more specific — how they/we learn inside a startup organization on different levels of growth.

Besides what I’ve experienced in other startups vs what I’m experiencing inI’ve needed to understand how other people who succeeded globally did it.

Elad Gil and his High Growth Handbook came as a no-brainer.

And, boy, oh boy, it delivered.

It helped me synthesize a lot of theory I was gathering on my master program and connect it to the experience I had in various organizations.

I may be understanding why some theories are just not working in early startups, but are thriving in scale ups or established organizations.

And most importantly, what are some early decisions you need to make more carefully than others?

Cause even tho they seem insignificant to you when you need to make them, they can backfire quite hard later on.
