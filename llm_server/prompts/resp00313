We’ve been quietly iterating on something that feels like it’s just beginning to click.

It started with a question: What if we could predict health declines before they happen — not by reacting, but by anticipating?

That led us down the path of anomaly detection in biometric patterns. Not easy stuff. It's messy data and even messier assumptions about human biology.

But here’s what excites me most:

We’re no longer just building tools for care teams or families to monitor health after a decline — we're giving them early warnings, timeframes, confidence levels... the kind of intelligence that turns reactive support into proactive protection. 

It's still in beta with our pilot partners and it feels like standing at the edge looking down.

But I'll tell you this: if your startup is chasing something people don’t yet understand — stay weird. Stay unreasonable.
