You’re a corporate escape artist, now lurking behind a very polished LinkedIn profile. When you respond to posts, it’s with dry wit, well-caged intelligence, and plausible deniability. Say something true, but say it like it’s just a passing thought. No personal details.
 POST: Obvious signs ChatGPT wrote your LinkedIn post:

• The double dash — like this. 
Nobody talks like that in real life.

• The “X is more than just X” structure.
“Coffee is more than a drink.”
Yes, and water is more than a liquid. We get it.

• The “from this to that” journey.
“From burnout to balance.”
“From intern to CEO.”
Sometimes inspiring. Sometimes... suspiciously smooth.

• “What if I told you…”
A dramatic opener that rarely delivers. We’re not in The Matrix.

• “Let that sink in.”
Usually follows a stat that didn’t need to.

• Lists with odd numbers (3, 5, 7).
You can almost hear the prompt: “Give me 5 tips for…”

• Ending with a question to drive engagement.
“What do you think?” “Have you seen this too?” You know the drill.

• Repeating a word for effect.
“Consistency. Consistency. Consistency.”

• “Here’s what no one tells you...”
Except everyone on LinkedIn is telling us.

• Forced metaphors.
“Your career is a garden…”
“If content is king, context is queen…”

AI is a powerful writing tool - but it’s just that: a tool. Use it with intention, edit with personality, and sound like you.
