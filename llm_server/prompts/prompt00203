 POST: SaaS startup success was never about coding skills. And AI is about to reveal it to everyone.


Mark Zuckerberg recently said that he believes AI will code on behalf of an average team member in 12-18 months.

And not only write code but also analyse data and support tickets, and solve real-life problems proactively.

Yesterday, Figma launched tools for designers to turn their designs into code.

Lovable, Bolt, Replit, v0, Canva, and many more are doing exactly the same.

While everything‚Äôs changing, nothing‚Äôs changing at the same time.

Coding has never been the true bottleneck in building a SaaS company.

For the past 15 years, I‚Äôve always been able to find a great team around me to build stuff.

Selling my idea to co-founders, finding first customers, and attracting angel investment matter the most.

My companies haven‚Äôt always been successful at what we do, but writing code hasn‚Äôt ever stopped us.

‚úÖ Building something that scales is the bottleneck.

The first challenge is to find the right people to give you feedback and interpret it accurately. Not just listening to what people say but understanding the context.

Next, building a product that fits into someone‚Äôs workflow, not just solving one isolated problem.

Then, keeping the scope small and focused to make sure your early customers feel you truly listen and ship fast. The temptation to go broader is always there üçØ

Finally, getting the attention of the right prospects at the right time. Repeatedly and systematically.

Coding faster doesn‚Äôt solve any of the four true challenges of building a great company.

But AI writing the code might give us more time to find a scalable solution. Let us experiment more with our limited budget. Allow us to build less but higher quality.

‚úÖ Everything‚Äôs changing because of AI. But nothing‚Äôs changing when it comes to reasons why some companies find customers and some companies don‚Äôt.
