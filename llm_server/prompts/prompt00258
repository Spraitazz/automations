I absolutely love Nicole Parlapiano's perspective here about risk

She says you should get fired for NOT taking enough risks

She is absolutely right.

So many marketers I know would rather be safe and wrong, than risk being right.

It's easy to get alignment, tick all the boxes, stick to convention, avoid anything too risking that might end up 'failing'

But not taking a risk is actually the riskiest thing you can do

One illustration of this is The Extraordinary Cost of Dull pioneered byandwhere they actually calculated a cost of being dull. It turns out that on average you would have to spend close to £10m more media to make a dull campaign match an interesting one

Worth considering before you press go on that safe campaign or idea

You don't even need to treat it like a casino either because atwe have built a testing platform that measures the emotional response to ideas and advertising before they launch.

Worth considering whether you are playing it too safe

This is one of my favourite episodes of all time - link in comments
