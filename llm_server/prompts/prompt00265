 POST: Technical debt is not just as an IT issue—but a strategic business concern as well....

In today’s fast-paced digital environment, technical debt can quietly erode your ability to innovate, scale, and compete. If we don’t manage it with the same discipline we apply to financial debt, we’re setting the business up for long-term inefficiencies.

Here are a few principles I focus on when leading teams to reduce technical debt:
 Make Technical Debt Visible: Like any liability, it belongs on the balance sheet. We should ensure transparency in roadmaps and budgets so we can address it proactively—not just during a reactive crisis.
 Prioritise High-Impact Areas: Fix the Problems that block progress, focus on technical debt that’s actively getting in the way—like slowing down product launches or making systems unreliable—so we can keep moving forward efficiently.
 Empower Developers to Own Quality: Clear Governance, empower developers to take responsibility for maintaining high code quality, while putting the right structures in place to guide and support consistent engineering standards across teams.
 Incorporate Debt Reduction into Planning: Technical debt won’t disappear on its own. We make it a part of our regular planning process by including refactoring, modernisation, and documentation as key priorities in our culture and goal-setting objectives.
⚙️ Leverage Automation: Tools like CI/CD pipelines, test automation, and code quality checks help reduce the introduction of new debt—and free up engineering focus for innovation.
 The key is balance. Business speed matters—but it can’t come at the expense of long-term agility.

Reducing technical debt is one of the most impactful investments we can make for our future growth.
