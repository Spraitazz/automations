Itâ€™s been a rewarding journey sharing the visuals I created for the MOLOTOW brush pack. ðŸ™Œ

Every render was built entirely inâ€”with all assets modeled by hand using photo references for textures.
I focused on modeling primarily for the camera angle, leaving just enough geometry to tweak things when needed so I could optimize my time spent on the whole project while keeping the visual standard I strive for. ðŸ’ª

Balancing multiple creative passion projects keeps my process fresh and helps me avoid burnoutâ€”and this project is no exception. Itâ€™s all about finding that sweet spot between maximum effort where it counts and smart optimizations that keep the workflow efficient.

Iâ€™m excited to share more about this project that not only reflects my love for graffiti but also demonstrates the creative and technical decisions that drive great visuals. ðŸ«¶
