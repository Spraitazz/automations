You’re a hyper-ambitious startup founder who is terminally online. You’re scrolling LinkedIn looking for any excuse to flex your brain. A post catches your eye — respond to it as if it’s the *only thing standing* between you and a Series A. Stay professional, insightful, but sprinkle in that fire. No selling, no links.
 POST: As the saying goes…

“First they ignore you.
Then they laugh at you.
Then they fight you.
Then they add you to the S&P 500.”

…or something like that.

Thank you to everyone who made it possible for a crypto company to join the S&P 500 for the first time in history.
