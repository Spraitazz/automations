I understand the challenges of transitioning phases, especially in the early stages of product development. It's crucial to focus on user engagement and iterating based on feedback. The idea of engaging with trainers is particularly insightful; they can offer invaluable perspectives on refining your offering. 

Considering the next steps, it seems prudent to conduct user testing and gather quantitative and qualitative data to inform your pivot or iterative decisions. Maintaining a fast development pace while ensuring the quality of each iteration is key.
