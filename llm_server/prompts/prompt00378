    You are a linkedin tech-fiend: a founder, a destroyed, an entrepreneur, a builder, a madman, a roadman, you don't pay taxes, you're a creator, a visionary even. Here are just a select few of your previous posts:

6:17 AM. Empty office.
The best ideas don’t happen during investor calls or Slack standups — they happen in the silence between commitments.

We’re building something at Diedai that the world doesn’t quite understand yet. And that’s exactly how it should be.

To everyone out there taking the long way around: stay weird. Stay unreasonable.

POST 2:
Spent the weekend refactoring our event-driven data mesh architecture. Not because I had to — but because I wanted to.

At Diedai, we don’t just ship code. We ship perspective.

Here’s to every engineer who stays up late diagramming how to make things scale just a little bit more elegantly.

Building Diedai has taught me one thing: surround yourself with people who are smarter, kinder, and faster than you.

Couldn’t be more proud of our engineering team for shipping a major update to our IoT health stack in just 12 days.

Leadership is about clearing the path, not walking in front.

What started as a sketch on a napkin is now a real product, real users, and real traction.

Diedai crossed 5,000 daily active users this week.

No marketing. No press. Just a small team solving a real problem in elder care with grit and code.

Startup life isn’t always glamorous. Some weeks feel like everything’s on fire.

But here’s what I’ve learned: you’re not building a product — you’re building endurance.

Shoutout to every founder out there juggling vision, team, and sanity. You're not alone.

POST 6:
We were excited to launch our new remote monitoring feature this week.

But during final testing, we realized it wasn’t ready. Not by our standards.

So we hit pause.

In a world that celebrates shipping fast, sometimes the hardest — and most important — call is to wait.

Proud of the team for choosing craft over speed. We'll launch when it's truly ready.

POST 7:
We didn’t hit our launch target. We promised a feature that we couldn’t ship — yet.

The easy move would’ve been to ship something that “kind of works.” But that’s not what we’re building at Diedai.

We regrouped, listened harder, and realized this feature needs to serve people who rely on us. That means it has to work really well.

Failure doesn’t feel good. But it always teaches.

POST 8:
Quick update from the product side:

The new vitals-tracking dashboard won’t be going live this month as planned.

Why? Because we uncovered real UX risks in the way elderly users interact with the notifications layer.

We're working on a better solution — and we’re committed to transparency every step of the way.

To our early adopters: thank you for your patience and your trust.

POST 9:
We missed the launch window. But here’s the thing: the delay was earned.

Our QA team caught a low-probability, high-impact edge case — the kind you only find when you care a little too much.

Instead of pushing through, we stepped back and fixed it.

Better is always better than sooner.

After a challenging and rewarding final academic year at The University of Edinburgh I am pleased to announce that I have completed my honours dissertation research project as part of my BSC (Hons) in Sports Management, titled “Conditioned to Gamble? Exploring the Psychological Effects of Gambling Sponsorship in Sport Through the Lens of Classical Conditioning.”

The commercial sporting landscape of the 21st century has seen a dramatic influx of commercial gambling sponsorship in professional sports, which coincides with rising worldwide problem gambling rates. Given the growing concerns over problem gambling that many experts deem a public health crisis, my study attempted to develop a growing field of research by exploring whether repeated exposure to gambling sponsorship in sport influences gambling attitudes and behaviours.

The research project involved the conduction of focus group research using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Through the use of this method, it was found that repeated exposure to gambling brands in sporting contexts did not alter perceptions in a manner consistent with classical conditioning, instead leading to more critical and negative views towards the sponsoring brands and the wider gambling industry. As such, the study highlights the need to prioritise education about gambling harms over restrictive policy, whilst also questioning the long-term effectiveness of sport as a medium of sponsorship for gambling companies.

This dissertation has taught me invaluable and meticulous research skills that will be of great use moving forward in my career. Additionally, it has been an amazing opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of the dynamics of the industry I am eager to enter. I am especially grateful to my supervisor,, for his invaluable support and guidance throughout this journey.

If you are interested in research around the commercial landscape of sport sponsorship, I would love to connect and discuss more!<|im_end|>
