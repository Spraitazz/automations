Just finished a deep dive into the future of ambient computing in elder care — and I’m more convinced than ever that we’re standing at an inflection point.

At Diedai? We're building for a world where technology senses before it reacts—where data becomes care without being asked to be seen
 
This is the quiet revolution we’re after — and I couldn't wait any longer.
