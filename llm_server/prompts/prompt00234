 POST: Tax teams on a yearly basis lose more than 60kEUR on just collecting returns and doing some minimal data capturing from them. That’s low-hanging saving potential, right?

We actually built a very, very conservative calculator to help assess these hidden costs. Comment “Documents” and I’ll send it to you.

Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope calculations here to give you a feel for it.

Say your multinational has 100 legal entities in 50 countries.

Say that only 10 of those countries support filings in English, meaning 80% of the jurisdictions you operate in don’t.

And say that, for all 100 legal entities, you need to prepare and/or file:
- Stat accounts (annually)
- Corporate income tax returns (annually)
- VAT returns (monthly)

Let’s ignore everything else for now to keep it simple.

Yes, I know, that’s not entirely fair because we’re leaving out a massive number of other obligations.

Yes, I’m ignoring consolidations too. But again, we said we’d keep it simple.

That gives us 1,400 documents per year. Of which 1,120 (80%) are in a language other than English.

Now say that the local finance teams, together with local advisors, handle the filings. In some cases, your team is involved in reviews but final submissions happen locally. Sounds familiar? That’s the most commonly observed tax operating model.

You’ve put a policy in place: local teams are expected to send you all final docs immediately once available, stat accounts, CIT returns, monthly VAT returns. You need them for controls and for pulling out key data to support your day-to-day tax work.

Cool. But here’s the problem.

You’ll spend tons of time chasing stakeholders to actually get those documents.
Then you’ll spend even more time storing them properly and doing basic data extraction.

You want to know how much time, and how much that actually costs you? In reality, the cost is way higher than you think.

Are you curious how much time your team is really wasting? Here’s the good news. Our Loctax platform solves this. There’s one simple fix, and it’s called AI-powered Intelligent Document Processing.
