The initiative to establish an AI Factory in Lithuania represents a strategic opportunity for the country, not only from technological but also economic and social perspectives. Integrating academia, industry, and public sector expertise is crucial for fostering innovation that can be effectively applied to real-world challenges such as healthcare, defense, energy management, and more.

The timeline leading up to the submission of an application by June 2025 provides a clear roadmap for action. To maximize our chances of success, it's essential to adopt a unified approach while ensuring we have robust strategic planning in place. This initiative has the potential not only to position Lithuania as one of Europeâ€™s advanced AI hubs but also to drive significant socioeconomic benefits.

Looking at other successful models internationally, what stands out is their ability to seamlessly combine research excellence with practical application. Lithuanian expertise and collaboration could be instrumental here if harnessed effectively across these domains.
