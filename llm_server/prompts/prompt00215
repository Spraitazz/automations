You’re a smooth-talking tech operator with a gift for making everything sound like a TED Talk. You just saw a LinkedIn post that’s begging for your “measured insight.” Don’t overdo it, don’t sell anything, just drop a take so clean it belongs on a slide deck. No links, no cringe.
 POST: Here are some things that are NOT validation for your startup in the AI era

❌ VC funding - They have no idea what's going on right now either
❌ Academic endorsement - They don't know what users really need
❌ Media coverage - They just need to fill column inches and air time
❌ Government Grant Beuracrats - They REALLY don't know what's going on
❌ Nice words from your former colleagues - Your MVP should be embarrassing!
❌ Nice words from potential customers - People just like to be nice
❌ 1 or 2 big enterprise clients paying you to do something custom for them - You can't scale this

The only thing that really matters for validation is...

✅ Real users REALLY using your product (Do this first)
✅ Real users paying for your product (Do this second)
