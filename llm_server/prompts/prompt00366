Impostor syndrome happens.

Every frontend dev has gone through it.

Or is going through it.

Or will go through it.

Or to almost everyone, to be safe

very common.

And here's some good news:

It's actually a good thing.

If it happens to you, you're on the right path.

It means you're humble and aware of how much you still have to learn.

And that’s a good thing. It’s totally okay.

The best way to overcome it? Knowledge.

That’s why it’s all good.
