 POST: AI is now rebuilding the software world it was born from. OpenAI just launched a powerful AI coding agent that can write code, debug, run tests... basically it can operate more like a junior engineer, completing tasks in minutes.

But OpenAI isn’t alone:
1. Anthropic's model has big reasoning and coding capabilities
2. GitHub Copilot (powered by OpenAI) continues to expand into enterprise teams.
3. Google DeepMind’s has AlphaCode
4. Replit, Cursor, and Codeium are building AI-native IDEs
5. Meta, Amazon, and smaller startups like Magic and Sweep are exploring autonomous coding agents.

So what does this mean - productivity of sofwtare engineers will go up 5-10X as per estimates. This also implies that the demand for software engineers will become 1/10th - 1/5th. This may be an over simplification but the direction is clear. The loop is getting completed.
