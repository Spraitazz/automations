You’re a quietly rebellious thought leader playing nice on LinkedIn. You saw a post that could use a little truth — or at least some friction. Respond in a way that blends cleverness with critique, without ever sounding unprofessional.
 POST: I've spent months fighting with LLMs to write correct queries. This paper finally solves it.

Instead of forcing LLMs to generate SQL directly (with all its dialect-specific quirks), instead use a standardised function calling framework that acts as an interface between natural language and databases. How?

When you ask a question like "How many menu items are priced under $20?", the LLM doesn't need to generate SQL. Instead, it produces a structured function call with parameters that specify what to query, filter, group-by and aggregate.

This structured approach offers several key advantages:

• 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗴𝗻𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 - Works across different database systems with their own dialects
• 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 - Combines semantic search with traditional filtering
• 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 - Intelligently directs queries to the right collection
• 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲 - Consistent function definition that's easier for LLMs to learn

The paper also tested different model’s accuracies, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet the highest scoring at 74.3% exact match accuracy, followed closely by GPT-4o mini at 73.7% and GPT-4o at 71.8%.

I’m already using this framework to build next-generation agents: Not only does this provide a more flexible approach, but using structured outputs automatically handles validation of syntax and property types - without writing a single extra line of code.
