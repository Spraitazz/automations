Alright, let's create POST 10.

The goal is to write a LinkedIn-style tech-founder/post from the perspective of someone who runs or works at an innovative startup. It should reflect elements present in previous posts — talk about engineering challenges and successes (like building architectures), leadership lessons learned while growing teams / company culture through hardship, stealth mode growth that shows tangible progress despite no public marketing effort ("no press", etc.), handling delays over pushing ahead with suboptimal solutions even when pressure is high to "ship fast," maintaining user-centric values in product development especially regarding accessibility issues faced by older adults (elder care context), and finally showcasing personal commitment while showing appreciation for team efforts. Make sure it's engaging, authentic-sounding.

Also ensure that all the hashtags included at end relate directly back content of this new post.
Okay let me start drafting something along those lines...

Now I need to write POST 10 as requested in natural conversational tone matching previous posts - no markdown here just plain text with emojis and hashtag placements typical for LinkedIn-style tech founder postings. Need approximately same length & vibe.

Alright time...
