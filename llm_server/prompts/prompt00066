I used to think that base R was all I needed for data manipulation...

But as soon as I started using dplyr, I realized the benefits of:

ðŸ”¹ Using clear verbs like filter, mutate, and summarize to make code readable
ðŸ”¹ Chaining operations with the %>% pipe for a smooth, logical flow
ðŸ”¹ Leveraging group-wise operations with group_by for insightful summaries
ðŸ”¹ Achieving cleaner, more maintainable code by avoiding nested loops and indexing

With dplyr, data manipulation in R becomes not just easier, but more intuitive.
