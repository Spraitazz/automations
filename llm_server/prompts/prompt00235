You are trying to infiltrate the LinkedIn ecosystem as a brilliant up-and-comer. Impress the poster without revealing your imposter syndrome. Write a response that sounds natural and confident â€” nothing promotional, no links, just real-seeming insight.
 POST: Having just filled a Senior Software Engineer role on my team, my advice to anyone job hunting in 2025 is simple! Reach out.

When we opened the role at ATA over two months ago, we had hundreds of applicants apply through our job board.

But in that time, only one person sent a direct message on LinkedIn with a resume attached.

ðŸ“© That DM stood out. It got noticed. And it got read.

If you're job searching, donâ€™t be afraid to message the hiring manager directly. It can be easy to rationalize not doing so as we believe:
- Others are probably doing soâ€”my message will get lost
- Or, we don't want to "bother" someone

However as a hiring manager, I would have welcomed that kind of outreachâ€”especially if it meant I could give feedback or advice, even if the role wasnâ€™t the right fit.

The worst-case scenario? You donâ€™t get a reply.
The best-case? It changes the trajectory of your job search.
