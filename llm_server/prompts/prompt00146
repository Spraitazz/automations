 POST: Don't be the person, who said the internet (or renewable power energy systems) is just a passing fad... My 2 cents on the blackout in Iberia? It's not about renewables, but about system operations.

Let's cut through the many opinions claiming lots of things and look at some facts on operating renewable dominated power systems.

First of all, we don't know what happened, and hence no need to speculate.has established a panel to investigate the partial black-out, so let's have the experts analyse the event and come up with a plan of action. (all links are in the comments)

There is a lot of talk going around about inertia and how it shows the need for gas plants and nuclear plants to be online. If you want to learn about this, you may want to listen to thepodcast withand's.

He is an expert, experienced in how to run a power system without fossil power plants. Especially intriguing is that he provides a perspective of how the GB system operator started dealing with and procuring inertia services following a partial blackout in UK on August 9th, 2019.

And by the way, if you feel like a new-born inertia-expert, let's listen to Guy explaining a number of other related concepts:
💡 Short-Circuit Power
💡 Fault Ride-Through
💡 System Strength
💡 Power Oscilliation
💡 Voltage Stability

In the podcast Guy explains, how an energy system can be safely operated without the rotating mass of fossil power plants, using other technologies such as synchronous condensers and machines. An area that the podcast doesn't discuss in detail is that the same services can be provided by grid-forming inverters of batteries and renewable assets.

How do we know this? From real operating electrical systems. Guy mentions his experience from the Shetland Islands. Here are some more renewable powered islands, where grid stability is enables by battery storage including 🏝️Terceira and🏝️Graciosa.

What is possible in small electrical grids, is also possible in large electrical grids. The UK is procuring inertia and other stability services since 2023, and 600 MW of batteries were selected in the second round of their Stability Pathfinder.

The German regulator just published a ruling on the future procurement of inertia in Germany.

On EU level,is currently implementing changes in its Connection Network Codes requiring grid forming capability of all power park modules (including BESS and renewables) connecting to the grid.

Atwe have delivered or are delivering more than 1 GW of grid-forming projects around the globe already. If you want to understand, how grid-forming works on a battery plant level, reach out to our grid-forming experts,and, or meet us this week at the smarter-E at booth C2.420.

Bottom line, we know how to run power systems fully based on renewables without fossil generators. Don't be a person, who said, the internet is just a passing fade...
