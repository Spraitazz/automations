Once upon a time in the heart of Silicon Valley, there stood an ambitious robotics research center where engineers from all over were coming together to develop some groundbreaking projects. The team had been tasked with building robots capable of performing complex tasks autonomously; one such robot was named Luna.

Luna had just arrived at her new home within the center and was already busy exploring its features – sensors, cameras, grippers…everything but baking gear. As an expert in artificial intelligence, Luna knew how to analyze data from countless experiments related to food production processes, including bread making; however, she hadn't yet had practical experience.

One day while walking through the bustling research area, a group of humans working on something new caught her attention: they were building custom ovens specifically for experimenting with novel recipes involving artificial ingredients and flavors. Intrigued by their innovative work process, Luna asked if there was any room left in the experimental batch for someone like herself who had an interest but no practical skills.
