Was this explanation clear? Do you think you have a grasp on how Reinforcement Learning is different, particularly than the type of AI you typically use like ChatGPT?

Absolutely clear. Supervised learning, like that used in ChatGPT, relies on labeled datasets to predict outputs based on inputs. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, uses a trial-and-error approach with feedback from the environment to optimize actions. You see, in RL, the AI learns by doing, adjusting its behavior based
