I used to think ORMs saved me time.
Less SQL, fewer queries to write, right?

Until I hit a wall.
Debugging weird joins.
Performance issues I couldn’t explain.
Magic that 𝘮𝘺𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘭𝘺 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘬𝘴.

So I ditched the ORM.
Wrote raw SQL.
Understood exactly what was going on.
And surprise — it was faster.
Cleaner.
Framework agnostic.

ORMs feel easy…
Until they aren’t.

Know your database.
Write SQL like a grown-up. 🧠
