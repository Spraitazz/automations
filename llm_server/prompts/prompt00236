 POST: I built a browser extension that estimates the energy consumption of my ChatGPT usage ⚡️

It’s open source, fully private (everything runs locally), and works pretty smoothly.

A few heads-ups - this is an early version:
🚨 The methodology is based on estimates, and the assumptions about OpenAI's infrastructure are quite optimistic (e.g., assuming GPT-4o has low parameter activation, etc.).
🚨 Right now, it only works with ChatGPT, and the measurements assume the model in use is GPT-4o.
🚨 It currently supports Chromium (Chrome, Arc, etc.) browsers only.

The extension is free. Link’s in the comments. Super curious to hear your thoughts! 🌿
