A few months ago, I would’ve called this a feature. Today? It's infrastructure.

We’re rearchitecting our entire backend to be more scalable and maintainable — not just for growth but so we can continue shipping the things that matter without breaking everything else along with it.

Here’s what you don’t see: 20+ engineers silently refactoring code, writing tests no one asked them to write (but they did anyway), spending sleepless nights on edge cases only a few users would ever hit — and yet still finding ways around the mess we inherited from our old systems. 

The truth is that software isn't just written; it's maintained for decades after you ship.

So, if your team spends more time fixing things than building new features… don’t panic. You’re doing exactly what mature companies do: paying down technical debt so they can build better tomorrow.

Okay done!
