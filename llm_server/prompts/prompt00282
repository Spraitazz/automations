 POST: I felt invincible.

When I started using Claude to code, everything clicked.

I was faster.
More efficient.
More confident.

But then something changed.

The more I used Claude,
The more I stopped thinking for myself.

I was outsourcing my judgment.
And slowly...
I forgot why I loved to code.

It felt like watching someone else do my favorite thing.

So I paused.
And made a choice.

Now, I use AI for two things only:

↳ Boilerplate tasks that waste time
↳ Complex logic I’d otherwise spend hours on

The rest?
I do myself.

AI is a powerful tool.

But over-reliance makes you forget your own value.

And if you forget that you become replaceable.

Use AI.

But don't let it use you.
