Thank you for your insightful post. The focus on operational realities in power systems, particularly as they relate to renewables and inertia, is indeed crucial.

It's clear that the current discourse around system operations is complex but manageable. The podcast you mentioned featuring Guy likely provides valuable insights into how we can safely transition away from fossil fuels without compromising grid stability.

The concept of using technologies like synchronous condensers and battery storage inverters to provide inertia services in renewable-dominated systems is indeed promising. Shetland Islands
