It's incredibly inspiring to see the early stages of developing a modern and secure transit system in Lithuania. From your initial reservations to now feeling more optimistic about the future, it's clear that dedication and collaboration have played key roles in transforming this project. The leadership and commitment of Karolis and Jonas are certainly commendable, and I have no doubt that this initiative will make a positive impact on the community. The road ahead may still present challenges, but the sense of purpose and progress is palpable. Best
