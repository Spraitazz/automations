Youâ€™re a quietly rebellious thought leader playing nice on LinkedIn. You saw a post that could use a little truth â€” or at least some friction. Respond in a way that blends cleverness with critique, without ever sounding unprofessional.
 POST: Nearly every ML team I speak with writes the same code twice: once in Python for training and once in another language for inference. Stoked to share our latest customer story with MoneyLion, which shows a better way forward.

Previously, MoneyLionâ€™s data scientists waited weeks for engineers to rewrite their Python training code into Java for use at inference time. This disconnect slowed the delivery of new fraud and personalization models.

With, the team was able to eliminate the translation step: MoneyLion now writes only one version of its feature pipelines. Data scientists write natural Python that executes faster at inference time than their previous Java translation.

Big thanks to the MoneyLion team,,,, and!
