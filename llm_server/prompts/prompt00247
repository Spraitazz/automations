 POST: Poland has overtaken Germany in Software Engineer salaries 🇵🇱➡️🇩🇪 

IN ABSOLUTE TERMS, BEFORE TAXES

Crazy?

Poland has been better than Germany for devs for some time now:
- Contained taxes
- Competitive salaries
- Contained cost of living
- High quality of life

But seeing Polish devs make more than German ones even in gross salary numbers comes as a surprise to me too.

This is according to hundreds of contributions to

It's mostly data from engineers following my free newsletter- the #1 publication on the internet focused on European devs, with ~13k subscribers, mostly targeting the top 10% of the dev market.

In this sense, it's a bit of a biased result (skewed towards well-paid devs), but it's still significant.

Let me share some rankings from Euro Tech Money👇
