Just got a message from an engineer on our team: “I’ve been thinking about how to design this system more modularly — but I don’t want the feedback.”

Let me tell you why that’s one of my favorite things. It means they’re not just building software—they're questioning their own assumptions.

This is where magic happens, folks.
Great engineers are constantly rewriting what "good" looks like—because no codebase lives forever without a little soul-searching and iteration on the design layer every now & then (that’s why I always keep this notebook nearby for system architecture ideas).

When you see someone from your team having an existential crisis about their work, that's actually not bad news. That means they're growing—and challenging themselves to become better at what we do.

So if any of y’all ever get stuck or feel like everything is going wrong (or worse: perfect), please take it as a sign you might be doing something right 🔥

Okay, let me try my best. I need help thinking through this post in the context that was just shared.

First of all - what's your role at Diedai?
