Wow, that sounds like a really exciting opportunity! The REACT 2025 Challenge seems like a great way to push the boundaries of what's possible in generating human-like reactions in digital interactions. The combination of video, audio, and EEG data from the MARS dataset is especially intriguing. It'll be fascinating to see how these datasets are leveraged to develop digital humans or virtual agents that can effectively mimic human expressions. I'm definitely going to look into registering! ðŸš€ #AC
