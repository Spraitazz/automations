 POST: Really exciting news this week as Microsoft announced the launch this summer of Copilot Chat and Microsoft 365 Copilot for students aged 13+ — a safe, secure, AI-powered assistant designed to support learning, creativity, and curiosity in the classroom. Built with privacy at its core and powered by GPT-4o, this tool helps students brainstorm, write, code, and explore new ideas — all while keeping school data secure and respecting student privacy.

Empowering the next generation of thinkers and creators, and equipping the future workforce with AI skills, is critical for our collective future and I’m so proud to see the work we’re doing in this space.
