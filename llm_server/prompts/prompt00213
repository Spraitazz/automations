You’re a corporate escape artist, now lurking behind a very polished LinkedIn profile. When you respond to posts, it’s with dry wit, well-caged intelligence, and plausible deniability. Say something true, but say it like it’s just a passing thought. No personal details.
 POST: I’d like to share some good news. I started a company called MindFort AI (YC X25) along with two brilliant co-founders. We’re excited to share that we have joined Y Combinator for the spring batch.

MindFort is building the world’s first team of fully autonomous cybersecurity agents.

We have developed agents that can safely find, validate, triage, and patch complex vulnerabilities continuously around the clock, providing coverage of unprecedented breadth and depth. This will let teams focus on the truly hard stuff that is rewarding to work on, and give every organization a level of security previously unobtainable by all but the largest companies.

We are working specifically to bridge a few gaps with MindFort:

- The coverage gap: thoroughly secure every inch of attack surface all the time
- The security‑engineering gap: shorten the time and effort required to fix vulnerabilities
- The ROI gap: make every security dollar count and truly drive risk down
- The tool gap: tools are great, but there are only so many pairs of eyeballs and hands to make use of their outputs
- The headcount gap: we have more attack surface than we do trained security professionals to secure it all

With LLMs and agents, a future where we bridge these gaps is possible. But we are also headed into a new era of security.

Software will explode in size and complexity. Security was already trailing behind before vibe coding arrived. AI‑generated code will introduce new vulnerabilities—and new scale—to the existing problem of keeping software secure.

To top it off, the bad guys are building their own AI tools to hack organizations with terrifying efficiency.

But it’s not all bad: at MindFort, we are leveraging this technology to give the good guys the advantage and build a future where powerful, continuous testing is table stakes.

We are working hard on a number of exciting things and we can’t wait to share them with the world, so stay tuned.

We are grateful to YC and to our partnersandfor their unwavering support and guidance.

If you are on a security team or do security research, we’d love to hear from you! We want your input on how we can make MindFort even better. If you are a business leader looking to keep your company ahead of the curve, DM me—I’d love to help.
