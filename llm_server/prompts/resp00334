The past month has been a masterclass in trade-offs. We had a feature that was close — really close — to launch. It had the potential to change how caregivers interact with our platform. But we found a flaw that, while rare, could have serious consequences. So we paused. Again.

This isn’t about perfectionism. It’s about responsibility. When you're building something that people rely on, you don’t just ship “good enough.” You ship “good enough for them.” That means doing the hard work, even when the world is screaming for speed.

We’ve spent the last three weeks rethinking the architecture behind that feature. It’s not just about fixing the flaw — it’s about building something that’s resilient, intuitive, and built to last. And in doing so, we’ve learned more about our users, our team, and the kind of product we want to be known for.

The delay wasn’t easy. But it was necessary. And it reminded us why we started this in the first place.
