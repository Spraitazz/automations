...the historic gatekeepers of media have been dethroned.

... used to be the barriers to entry, but starting a media company today is totally different to even 3 years ago.

You don't need to live on a US coast!

Creators have already proven this, but AI is now supercharging the process. It is removing barriers and speeding things up like never before.

1. You can launch from anywhere → a rural farmhouse or a coffee shop thousands of miles from traditional media hubs.

2. You can build with minimal capital → what once required millions now starts with tools you already own and free platforms at your fingertips.

3. You can create a powerful network from scratch → without a single pre-existing industry connection.

4. You can find and grow your audience directly → bypassing traditional distribution channels entirely.

5. You can produce professional-quality content → accessible technology that rivals what once required expensive studios.

6. You can build with experts → using AI as a coach, agent etc.

This isn't incremental change.

it's a fundamental shift in who can build meaningful media businesses and how quickly they can scale.

Perhaps this is your sign!
