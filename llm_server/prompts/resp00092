The initiative to establish an AI Factory in Lithuania is a strategic move with far-reaching implications. Integrating academia, industry, and the public sector creates a fertile ground for innovation and sustainable development. This approach not only addresses technological challenges but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement and adaptation.

Leveraging our unique position within Europe, we can serve as a test bed for AI solutions that have broader regional or even global applications. The ambition to become one of the top four advanced DI centers in the EU by 2025 is ambitious yet achievable with focused effort and strategic partnerships.

The key lies not just in technological advancement but also in building robust frameworks for implementation, ensuring ethical considerations are at the forefront throughout the process.
