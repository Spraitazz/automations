An Electrically Injected and Solid State Surface Acoustic Wave Phonon Laser

In our latest paper (), we demonstrate the first ever solid state and DC electrically injected surface acosutic wave phonon laser. We do this by heterogeneously integrating a high-mobility and ultra-thin semiconductor (InGaAs) inside of a surface acoustic wave Fabry-Perot cavity made of lithium niobate and an aluminum acoustic distributed Bragg reflector. Applying a DC current to the semiconductor produces a population inversion of the electronic momentum states in the semiconductor. The electric field of the piezoelectric phonons in the lithium niobate allows a dipolar interaction with the inverted electronic population, producing stimulated emission that amplifies the thermal energy of acoustic waves in the cavity (a.k.a. the acoustoelectric effect). At large enough DC bias, the gain overcomes the round trip loss for one of the modes and produces a coherent oscillator at approximately 1 GHz (the mode we designed the Bragg reflectors for), exhibiting a sharp power threshold, dramatic linewidth narrowing, and a large power output (about 0.25 milliwatts of acoustic power).

This is the first-ever device of its kind, and the implications are substantial. Here are just a few examples. 1) SAW-based sensors that would have previously required an RF electronic source driving an interdigital electrode can now be operated with just a battery, reducing the SWaP, cost, and packaging complexity. 2) Because making reflectors is substantially less demanding than making transducers as frequencies get large, these oscillators can scale to extremely high frequencies--at least 70 GHz, as we show in the paper. You can even use waveguides with gain that completely eliminate DBRs. The gain for the acoustoelectric effect persists into the 100's of GHz, theoretically; so there may even be potential for producing ultra-low-SWaP oscillators in frequency bands where direct synthesis of sources is presently hard to achieve. 3) These oscillators can be used in conjunction with other acoustoelectric phononic components we've previously demonstrated, such as low-noise amplifiers, mixers, circulators, and filters to create complex RF signal processing capabilities with absolutely no transistor-based devices. 4) The gain bandwidth is enormous; so we can start to think about applications of mode-locked phonon lasers, which I personally find very exciting.

Happy reading!<|im_end|>
