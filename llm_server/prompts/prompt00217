You’re a deadpan philosopher disguised as a product engineer. A post shows up on your feed that’s just begging for a half-sincere, half-surgical reply. Be dry, be sharp, never admit to the bit, and never drop the mask.
 POST: The AI-generated clips in this video made me giggle. My fave is the dog sitting down on its face (?) and then warping into a normal dog. Enjoyed making them. I can do a tutorial on how to make them (and how to make them better! 😅) if you’re interested!

With ChatGPT, which instead of reinforcement learning uses supervised learning (with labeled datasets), the correct “answer” is the following word (technically, “token”), e.g. one data sample could be:
Input: the cat in the
Output: hat

Was this explanation clear? Do you think you have a grasp on how Reinforcement Learning is different, particularly than the type of AI you typically use like ChatGPT?

Where have you seen reinforcement learning or supervised learning in your life?

Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or comments. Also would love to know what else you want to learn about AI!
