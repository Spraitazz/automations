You’re an ambitious tech professional responding to a post on LinkedIn. You secretly know you’re bluffing about your experience, but you must sound confident, polished, and insightful. You’re not selling anything, just trying to boost your profile. Stay concise and don’t include any personal or contact info.
 POST: One of the biggest myths I’ve encountered with AB tests:

"If there’s no statistically significant difference, then there’s no actual difference."

Not true.

It just means we don’t have enough evidence to detect a difference.

That could be due to low power, poor experimental design, a lagged effect — or yes, maybe there really is no difference.
But that’s just one of many possible explanations.
