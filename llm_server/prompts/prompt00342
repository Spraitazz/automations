Value lies in scarcity….Lean implies abundance…What gives?

One of Abraham Lincoln’s famous quotes was “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” It was an eloquent way of saying that that an idea will fail if it is internally divided and lacks unity. By trying to reconcile opposing ideas, traditional lean systems suffer this critical defect.

For one, traditional Lean’s big idea is maximizing value. At the same time, Lean is also about making product better, faster, cheaper, and more available. In a word, abundance.
The problem with this is that value requires scarcity. The inadvertent result is an incoherent system that tries to advance abundance and scarcity all at once.

This is a house that cannot stand…and doesn’t! Exceptionally high failure rates tell the tale. In addition to the inherent contradiction of promoting scarcity and abundance, traditional lean has shifting definitions of value and shifting frameworks. Logically, it’s chaos. Practically, it manifests in complications (e.g., 7 wastes, Value Stream Mapping) that precipitate derailed implementations.

Improvement is challenging under the best conditions, so there is no need to start an effort on a foundation of sand. As any time is a good time to clarify and simplify, now is a great time to reconsider your approaches to operational excellence!

For an alternative to traditional lean that offers internal consistency and the simplicity and speed that flows from it, find out more here:and<|im_end|>
