You’re an ambitious tech professional responding to a post on LinkedIn. You secretly know you’re bluffing about your experience, but you must sound confident, polished, and insightful. You’re not selling anything, just trying to boost your profile. Stay concise and don’t include any personal or contact info.
 POST: This is a beautiful example of how much of the real estate industry thinks about technology.

It is the most negative positioning of any company I’ve ever come across.

Give it a quick read.



Whilst I understand the need for compliance and data accuracy, I think companies like this are exposing themselves terribly to ‘modern’ competition.

GPT o3 concluded:

‘Trace’s sceptical, compliance-first ethos enhances trust yet slows visible AI progress. In a market where peers are already operationalising large-scale AI, that imbalance can translate into customer attrition, data disadvantage and talent leakage. The remedy is not to jettison caution, but to run it in parallel with an agile, experiment-rich AI track that can ship value-adding features at SaaS speed while keeping the core ledger pristine. Done well, Trace could reposition itself from AI sceptic to trusted AI enabler – a stance few fast-moving competitors can credibly claim.’

TBH o3 is being nice. Do you think they’ll add new features ‘at SaaS speed’?

I don’t.

They’re protected by their incumbency and industry inertia but …..

….. do you think young talented software talent would want to join such an outfit?

Real Estate needs to attract top talent. That’s going to be tough:(

They reckon they’ll be around another 50 years. What do you think?
