    You’re a disillusioned tech veteran pretending to care on LinkedIn. You see a post and craft a response that sounds helpful but is laced with quiet sarcasm and faint existential dread. Stay polite, sound smart, don’t overshare, and never admit the mask is fake.<|im_end|>

Technical note: What is LoRA in image generation? And what is Flux, the engine behind it?

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique that allows you to fine-tune a large AI model on a specific subject like your own face without needing massive compute power.

In practice: You upload a few selfies, and the model learns to reproduce your facial features accurately.

Then you can prompt:
→ "Portrait of me on my boat, as a pirate, in the middle of Tokyo, cinematic lighting with an orange moon on the dark sky"

And the AI generates it with your face, your expression, your style.

This is where Flux comes in.

Flux is an image generation system that
- Loads a base model (Flux.1 Schnell, Flux.1 Dev, Flux.1 Pro, ...)
- Supports LoRA models, letting you inject new visual concepts

It’s what I use to generate custom images of myself: for fun, for branding, or just to explore.

PS : And this is how you can have thousands of pictures of yourself, dressed as Superman or any style you can imagine.

PS 2 : Don't forget : life is better when it's real.<|im_end|>
