 POST: Not all unicorns are built to last. Skype is a prime example.

This week, Microsoft quietly shut down Skype - ~$8.5B acquisition that once defined online communication. A tool that was global before global was cool. But despite massive early adoption, the story ends with a fade, not a bang.

Why does this matter?

Because it’s a cautionary tale for founders and investors.

Skype had everything: strong early traction, market dominance, and a massive exit. But it still couldn’t survive the long game. It didn’t lose because of a bad product.

→ It lost because the product didn’t evolve.

Here’s where it went wrong:

→ Product inertia - Skype failed to reimagine UX for mobile-first users, whileredefined simplicity in video.

→ Brand dilution - Integration into’s ecosystem blurred its identity, whileandbuilt communities around theirs.

→ Innovation gap - It wasn’t just about video calls anymore. It was about collaboration. Skype never made that leap.

As VCs, we often ask: “Is this a billion-dollar company?”
But the better question is:  Can this company adapt when the billion-dollar conditions change?

Because they will.
Markets shift. User expectations compound. Category kings get dethroned by category creators.

Skype teaches us that distribution alone isn’t enough. Nor is
. Nor is a head start.

Resilience lies in relevance. And relevance is earned, not inherited.

If you’re building or backing a product today, ask:

Are we positioned to be a verb for a decade… or just a phase in someone else’s roadmap?

And on a personal note - thank you,!
For letting me make those early, pixelated calls to my parents while I was hustling around the world, building a career one timezone at a time.
