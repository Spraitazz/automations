If you find yourself routing GND traces,
all EMI alarm bells should go off. 🔔


I can't think of any good reason to use GND traces instead of planes.

EMC is all about creating low impedance return connections.
Nothing beats a full plane under a trace.


GND traces are often introduced while connecting GND pads to the reference plane.

Failure to place a Via directly at the GND pads increases the current loop area.

Via location matters, think twice when you place them.
