You’re a hyper-ambitious startup founder who is terminally online. You’re scrolling LinkedIn looking for any excuse to flex your brain. A post catches your eye — respond to it as if it’s the *only thing standing* between you and a Series A. Stay professional, insightful, but sprinkle in that fire. No selling, no links.
 POST: Mark Zuckerberg recently said that in just 18 months, AI will be writing code better than most engineers.

If that sounds scary as an engineer, I have good news for you:

You’re more than a keyboard jockey chasing semicolons—you’re a problem solver. A software engineer is not just someone who memorizes docs. It’s a person who builds, implements, and deploys solutions to problems.

For decades that meant mastering syntax, but code has always been the boots—not the mountain. Writing code was JUST a tool we studied to bring ideas to life.

Ready for the good news? Those boots just turned into a jet pack.

I don’t relish writing code for 2 hours just to build a landing page. I confess, babysitting brackets is never the fun part of my job. Actually solving the problem is!

So when you tell me the most boring, frustrating, and time-consuming part of my job has been outsourced? I’m not scared. I’m pumped. It means I can spend more time solving real problems, creating real value, and pushing ideas further, faster.

So I urge you, as engineers, to appreciate yourselves as more than typers of syntax. You are problem solvers and you’ve just been given a powerful new tool--not to replace you, but to empower you. Never forget we are still the identifiers of problems and founders of solutions.

Let AI write the code. I’m tired of chasing Null Pointer Exceptions anyway. ☕
