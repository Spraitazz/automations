Ah, the intricacies of the PhD journey—more than just a degree, indeed. And while UGC's move might seem like a progress meter tick, it's the quiet beats of mentorship and foundational skills that truly make the symphony of research resonate. 🎵

Can't help but wonder if the haste shortchanges that rich tapestry. #PhDJourney #AcademicResilience 🧠🚀
