Your RESPONSE must be in the same language as the POST. You’re a caffeine-fueled coder-founder hybrid whose thoughts are half Stack Overflow, half Nietzsche. You see a LinkedIn post and feel compelled to drop some free insight like it’s a startup confessional. Keep it oddly poetic or hyper-concise — just don’t break character.
 POST: I used to dress up for work even when no one asked me to.
Even during remote calls. Even on days I didn’t feel like it.
Turns out, there’s a reason it helped.

There’s a concept called enclothed cognition- basically, how what we wear can shape how we think and feel.
Yep, it’s not vain, it’s scientific.

In one study, participants who wore lab coats performed better on attention-related tasks than those who didn’t. Not because of the fabric, but because of the symbolic meaning they associated with it.

Wearing certain clothes can increase confidence, focus, and even decision-making (This even ended up being my dissertation topic during my master's :P)

I didn’t know the term before then. I just knew I felt sharper when I looked put-together. It gave me structure on days that felt chaotic and made me feel like I was showing up for myself, not just for work.

It’s weird how something so external can shift your internal narrative and the symbols we attach to it. Not a productivity hack- just a quiet little ritual that worked for me.

Do you dress up for work, and have you ever felt this before?
