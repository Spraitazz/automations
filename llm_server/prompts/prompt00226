 POST: 🛠️ Built my own Perplexity-like LLM Info Assistant
(Yes, with web search and grounded citations!)
I’ve always been fascinated by how tools like Perplexity AI provide real-time, verifiable answers grounded in live web data. So I challenged myself to understand it more deeply by building a toy version from scratch- that’s the best way I learn.

🔎 Here’s what it does:
- Uses DDGS for web search
- Embeds results with’s text-embedding-3-small
- Runs vector similarity using FAISS to select relevant snippets
- Streams a grounded response from GPT-4o, along with [1], [2]-style research citations
- Caches conversational history for context

It was a fun deep dive into search ranking, embeddings, prompt engineering, and streaming chat completions (without relying on OpenAI's Hosted Tools).

🎥 I’ve attached a short demo video- would love your feedback or any exciting ideas to expand upon! Super happy to chat more.
Whether you are an engineer exploring LLMs or just curious about how grounded AI assistants work- hope this gives you a glimpse into how search + LLMs = reliable answers
