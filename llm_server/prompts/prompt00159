 POST: Hire a first-year, underpaid teacher over FAANG any day.

No, really.

I’ve seen too many people from FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) join a startup…and then the scrappy work starts. Suddenly it’s:

“Wait, I don’t have a full team for that?”
“Why are we talking to users this often?”
“Do I…actually have to write my own emails?”

FAANG folks are used to perks and presentations, to optimizing one tiny piece of the product, working four hours a day, and calling it hustle.

Early on in’s lifespan,hired a bunch of ex-Uber and FAANG people - but they just wanted to talk about perks and our number of users, and they resisted the scrappiness and risk-taking mentality that we needed (and still need) to scale.

Meanwhile, 90% of teachers build lesson plans from scratch every night, run a classroom of 32 kids solo, and spend their evenings calling families. Your best teachers…

➕ Work harder
➕ Make fewer excuses
➕ Care about impact, not LinkedIn clout

The logos on someone’s résumé don’t impress me.

Their motivation does. Their ability to make something out of nothing does. Their track record of caring about people (not perks) does.

A person doesn’t have to be from FAANG to do high-impact work… In fact, it’s probably better if they’re not.
