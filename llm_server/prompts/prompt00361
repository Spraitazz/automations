It's crazy to see how many people are complaining about programming languages speeds while doing things in loops that could be done in constant time (or at least amortized constant time).

If you're really concerned about your application's performance, the programming language should be the last—or second to last—thing you focus on.

Obviously, this includes frameworks and libraries too.

First, examine your algorithms and architecture. Only when you're certain you can't improve anything there should you look at changing technologies. Most likely, you won't see any significant improvement by switching.<|im_end|>
