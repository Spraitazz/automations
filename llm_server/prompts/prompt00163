 POST: Let's talk about newly announced Stripe Orchestration platform. 

For me that's the most interesting product announced at this year's Stripe Sessions. I had a privilege to discuss it back in March during the private Stripe event and it's good to see that it's finally out in the open.

I’ve been closely following Stripe’s push for open ecosystems, last year with Forward API and now moving into full orchestration. While it might not be the product for everyone, many merchants running on Stripe exclusively will find it useful.

For me, the devil is in the details and I’m still gathering information how this product will work in more challenging scenarios:

1) ❌ Closed accounts - this is a big issue across many merchants. Can you still use the software part of Stripe for orchestration? This is one of the bigger benefits of orchestration - being independent from payment provider account closures.

2) 📱 Apple Pay/Google pay routing. Since in most Western markets these methods have even bigger popularity than raw cards, an orchestrator without the ability to route these transactions is pretty much useless.

3) 🔐 Network tokenization - Usually Stripe handles network tokenization on behalf of the merchant and it’s not always clear which entities and Token requestor IDs (TRIDs) they’re using. Can you route payment using your own network tokens or just PAN?

4) 🦹‍♂️ Stripe Radar - for now it’s only available for Stripe transactions. That’s a shame, especially with the newly announced foundation model for fraud detection, but based on the previous Stripe roadmap it should come at a later date. I believe Stripe Radar could even be useful as a stand alone product for other orchestrators or big merchants with their own payments stack.

5) 🎛️ Provider selection - at this point it's unclear how many integrations Stripe is planning to have and if the plans are going to align with your business needs. But this is true for most orchestrators anyway.

Also I’m a bit sad to see that Shopify will be left out of this feature since you need to add one line to the payment request, which you cannot do easily. Wouldn’t be surprised that this was a political decision and a nudge from Shopify to prevent merchants from getting more independence.

Can't wait to test it myself. What are your thoughts on it? Happy to discuss!
