 POST: We got to 1 billion active users at Instagram while having less than 5% automated test coverage across our mobile apps. No, it wasn't dumb luck.

We did this with a technique called "dogfooding". It simply means using your own product as a regular end-user.

Instagram took dogfooding to an extreme by having employees use the main branch directly. This meant if you broke something, you immediately felt the pain.

When you combine this intense user-empathy with hiring world-class engineers, you have a quality control system that is 5x better than any test suite.

In contrast, I've seen so many engineering teams have 90% test coverage and a userbase 1/10 the size of Instagram's, and their product is still super broken.

You can't just declare a random number and have your engineers write good code. If they don't fundamentally care about quality, their tests will suck too.
