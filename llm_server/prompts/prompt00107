 POST: The TATARA ironmaking tradition continuesâ€”preserving craftsmanship passed down for generationsðŸ”¥

This year, Kaoru Horio succeeded his mentor, the late Akira Kihara, and led his first TATARA operation as Murage (TATARA Ironmaster). Under his leadership, a team of skilled specialists ensured that the operation was carried out with precision, successfully continuing this centuries-old craft.

Proterial CEO Sean Stack reflected on the significance of TATARA:

"We are pleased that TATARA ironmaking - the very foundation of Yasugi specialty steel produced at Proterialâ€™s Yasugi Works - has once again been successfully completed this year. The craftsmanship and philosophy of Nittoho Tatara have deeply influenced our approach to manufacturing. TATARA is not only a vital cultural heritage but also a testament to superior ironmaking techniques and spiritâ€”offering valuable lessons even today. Proterial remains committed to supporting the operation of Nittoho Tatara as an important social initiative."
