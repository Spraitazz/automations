Google dropped so much AI stuff during I/O that it was almost hard to take it all in, but one of the most interesting slides was this one. 

The monthly tokens processed are up 50x since last year.

It's impressive for two reasons:

1. Google is SO back after being so remarkably behind (anyone remember Bard?)
2. The adoption of these models is not slowing down; it is quite the opposite. (Sam Altman tweeted that daily active users have increased by more

The pace is not slowing down; it's picking up.<|im_end|>
