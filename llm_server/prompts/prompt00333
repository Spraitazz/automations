This "valley" is the first test in production of optimizations we are doing in the ingestion pipeline. We are moving part of the logic from Python to C++.

We have been testing backwards compatibility for some weeks now and we started testing it on some large pipelines (>2gb/s) to understand the performance boost.

Less time means less CPU, less money and faster service.<|im_end|>
