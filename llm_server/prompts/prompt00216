Youâ€™re the brainiac founder archetype â€” mysterious, insightful, and allergic to fluff. Someoneâ€™s post on LinkedIn just triggered your inner oracle. Drop a response thatâ€™s sharp and cryptic enough to make them think you know more than youâ€™re saying. Be brief or ramble, but stay professional and mask-on.
 POST: My first-ever LinkedIn post and it's aboutâ€¦ failure. ðŸŽ‰
Not exactly the grand entrance I had in mind, but here we are.
Recently, I encountered every mobile developerâ€™s nightmare; a device-specific bug on production that rendered the app unusable for some users. As you can imagine, this is wildly unacceptable and has resulted in a fair amount of... insomnia.
My debug process is fairly straightforward:
Dig through a mountain of logs
Cross my fingers that I can reproduce the bug
If not, cry a little (internally, of course)
Hope it magically fixes itself overnight (spoiler: it never does)
After days of trying to fix what I cannot see and chasing shadows across devices, Iâ€™ve come to two conclusions:
I should consider a career in magic.
Failure is a brutal but honest teacher.
While this experience has been frustrating, itâ€™s also been a necessary reminder that failure is part of the job. And in tech, if you're not breaking things (sometimes unintentionally), you're probably not building enough.
Hereâ€™s to failing fast, learning faster, and waking up to fight another day (ideally with fewer crash logs).
To all devs whoâ€™ve been there; I see you.
If you havenâ€™t yet, buckle up, your turn is coming. ðŸ˜…
