Slow down, software engineer. 
 
Your burnout isn't from lack of skill. 

It's from playing the wrong game.

I just spoke with a brilliant engineer who:

• Sent 300+ applications in 3 months
• Got only 5 interviews
• Failed 4 due to "live coding nerves"
• Is now considering a $70K pay cut out of desperation

This shouldn't be happening.

But it is. Everywhere.

Here's what the tech industry doesn't want you to know:

1. Technical interviews aren't measuring your ability to code

They're measuring your ability to perform under artificial pressure.

That's it.

2. Your resume isn't even being read

Most applications get 6-7 seconds of attention before a decision.

3. The "best practices" they're testing you on?

No one actually follows them day-to-day.

So here's what actually works in 2025:

• Stop mass-applying (quality > quantity)
• Build a strategic network (80% of my clients land roles through 2nd-degree connections)
• Practice storytelling, not just coding (the engineer who can explain WHY always beats the one who just knows HOW)

I've helped engineers who were sending hundreds of applications land multiple offers in weeks.

The difference?

They stopped playing a rigged game.

They built a system that works FOR them, not against them.

If you're tired of the application hamster wheel and ready for a different approach, I've created a free guide: "The Senior Job Search Playbook"

Comment "Playbook" below if you want me to send it your way. (We need to be connected)

Remember:

Your worth isn't defined by how well you solve arbitrary coding puzzles while someone watches.

It's defined by the real problems you can solve when given the chance.<|im_end|>
