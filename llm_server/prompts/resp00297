It's a strange dichotomy: the more we build, and iterate on our product for elderly users at Diedai; the less certain I am of what will ultimately stick.

But that’s exactly why this project feels so thrilling. It challenges us to redefine boundaries — both in tech capability but also how older adults use technology every day.
As a team pushing hard toward an age-in-place future, there's no room for complacency or overconfidence: each decision is like peeling back another layer of onion.

Every user interaction we record gives insight into unmet needs. Every bit and byte becomes data that can improve their lives — even in small ways at first.
So how do you lead a team to deliver not just what's asked, but the experience older adults really crave?

Start with humility: accept there’s always more understanding left within your product or service.

And foster empathy among all teams. Empathy isn’t something that can be added late — it has already been baked into our DNA at Diedai.
We strive to see beyond age groups and cater for everyone's unique journey, while respecting the wisdom of those with longer experience in life’s challenges as much we do emerging technology trends.

As a community, how are you integrating these lessons from tech-forward thinking founders like me?
