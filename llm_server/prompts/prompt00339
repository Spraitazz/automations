 Had a bit of an epiphany about LLMs today.

I’ve been working on a hobby project in C, and wow — it’s tough. Between memory management, the quirks of the language, and the ridiculous amount of code it takes to do simple things, it’s a far cry from Ruby. Something that would take me 15 minutes in Ruby is taking me an embarrassing amount of time in C.
So why am I using C? Because this project has some real performance requirements I can’t ignore.

That’s where LLMs come in — total game-changer. It’s so much easier to ask specific questions and get clear answers than to sift through vague documentation.

And that got me thinking: if LLMs can help us write code faster and better, what’s stopping us from writing super-performant code more often? We’ve now got a real chance to build better software by working closer to the metal without the usual pain.

It’s an exciting time to be an engineer.

Let’s keep pushing for excellence. 

Curious how others are using LLMs in low-level dev — what’s your experience?<|im_end|>
