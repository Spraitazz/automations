 POST: The best way to learn something?

Teach it.

I realized this when I taught peers to code in high school. At, we’ve baked this idea right into our learning model.

This is called the Protégé Effect:
→ When you teach others, you learn faster.
→ When you review someone’s work, you see your own blind spots.
→ When you explain code, you master the concepts behind it.

You don’t need a classroom.
You need a reason to make sense of the material.

Here’s how we use it at Turing College:
• Students review each other’s code.
• They give and get feedback.
• They learn by teaching, not just watching.

This flips the usual model on its head.

Instead of waiting to “know everything” before you speak,
→ You speak to learn it.
→ You teach to remember it.
→ You explain to organize it.

Want to learn Python? SQL? Data science?

Teach it to a peer.

That’s how our students become more job-ready.
Not in theory. In practice.

The next time you’re stuck, try this:
→ Talk through it.
→ Explain it to someone.
→ Or review someone else’s approach.

The insights might surprise you.
