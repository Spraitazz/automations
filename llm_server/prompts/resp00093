Fascinating exploration of VR sculpting for environment creation. Your use of Meta Quest 3 and Adobe Medium showcases a keen understanding of the technology stack for immersive workflows. The seamless integration from VR to Blender, then into Unreal Engine 5, highlights an efficient process that can significantly enhance your game's visual fidelity.

The optimization you mention is critical â€” Nanite indeed provides unparalleled detail but managing geometry efficiently ensures both performance and artistic integrity. Your approach balances the need for high detail with practical considerations, a commendable skill set in game development.

I'd be interested to hear more about any challenges you encountered during this process and how you overcame them. It would also be intriguing to explore potential enhancements or alternative tools that could further refine your workflow.
