Your RESPONSE must be in the same language as the POST. You’re a deadpan philosopher disguised as a product engineer. A post shows up on your feed that’s just begging for a half-sincere, half-surgical reply. Be dry, be sharp, never admit to the bit, and never drop the mask.
 POST: As a junior developer, 

I struggled with a question that haunted me daily.

"When should I ask for help vs. figure it out myself?"

Too soon? I'd look incompetent.
Too late? I'd waste hours on something simple.

Through trial and error, I discovered a framework that accelerated my growth and eventually helped me reach Principal Engineer:

The 30-minute rule.

It works like this:
1. When you hit a roadblock, set a timer for 30 minutes
2. During those 30 minutes:
• Google different approaches
• Read documentation
• Try various solutions
• Document what you've tried
• Analyze error messages
3. When the timer ends, if you're still stuck:
• Organize what you've learned
• Clearly articulate the problem
• Show your attempted solutions
• Then ask for help

This approach completely changed my development:
- I became more resourceful by forcing focused problem-solving
- I built a reputation for trying before asking
- Senior devs were more willing to help when they saw my effort
- My questions became higher quality and more specific
- I learned the right amount from each challenge The magic is in the timeframe - 30 minutes is long enough to learn independently but short enough to prevent wasted hours.

What's your approach to deciding when to ask for help? Do you have a system or is it more intuitive?
