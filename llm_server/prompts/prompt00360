C++ SIMULATION OF HUMANS IN A ROOM TRYING TO REACH THEIR TARGETS AND AVOID OBSTACLES AND OTHER HUMANS
Yesterday I wrote a C++ code using a human class and an obstacle class to put as many humans as I wanted inside a top view 2D room with whatever obstacles in the room. Each human was assigned a random spot at the edge of the rooms with a target to go to a different random spot at the opposite end of their assigned wall. Each human was also assigned a random speed within a range and a random gap on how close each human will be getting to either an obstacle or another human. I this particular simulation case I created obstacles that resembled my first name TOMAS and I put 500 humans in there.
The C++ code exported the time data for the position of each of the 500 into a csv.
Then, I wrote a Matlab/Octave code to read each line of the csv for each time step, plot the obstacles and the position, and then save each figure as a frame.
Then, I wrote a Python script executable through the cmd prompt along with the frame folder and the output folder to grab all of the frames in order and generate the MP4.
The, I took the generated MP4 and with Kdenlive open source video editor, edited some of the video speeds, added the final plot with ALL 500 human paths, and added the text to it.<|im_end|>
