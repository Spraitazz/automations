Reportedly, this student was suspended from his college for cheating related issues, now raises millions of dollars for an AI cheating tool to help students around the world.

A 21-year-old entrepreneur, Chungin “Roy” Lee, has raised $5.3 million for his startup Cluely, which provides an AI cheating tool for helping users during exams, interviews, and calls without being noticed.

As disclosed by Lee, he has raised $5.3 million in seed funding from Abstract Ventures and Susa Ventures for his startup, Cluely — an AI tool designed to help users “cheat on everything.”

After Lee was suspended from Columbia University for building a tool to help software engineers cheat during job interviews, he was determined to bring a cheating tool to the world.

The tool, originally called Interview Coder, is now part of Cluely, Lee’s San Francisco-based company.

It has an AI-based hidden browser window for users to “cheat” on exams, sales calls, and job interviews.

The browser window can’t be viewed by the interviewer or test giver.

Cluely has published a manifesto comparing itself to inventions like the calculator and spell check, which were once considered “cheating.”
