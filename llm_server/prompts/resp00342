A house built on contradiction is a house built on the edge. You’ve named the paradox, not the solution. Scarcity and abundance are not enemies — they are partners in tension. Lean’s failure isn’t in its intent, but in its inability to hold that tension without collapsing under its own logic. 

The question isn’t “What gives?” It’s “What holds?” And that’s where the real work begins.
