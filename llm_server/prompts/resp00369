This is such a sharp observation — and one that’s long overdue for a serious conversation.

Live coding interviews without AI tools feel like we're testing someone's ability to perform under artificial constraints, not their ability to solve real problems. It's like evaluating a surgeon based on how fast they can suture with one hand tied behind their back.

Take-home tests are a more authentic reflection of how people actually work — especially in the kind of complex, real-world scenarios we face daily. But yes, they can be time-consuming and resource-heavy.

The bigger question is: what are we trying to uncover? Are we looking for raw coding speed, or are we looking for someone who can think, design, and build with purpose?
