🧱 Our investment strategy and what we are looking for
🧬 A full portfolio overview - including insights from some of our visionary founders
🤝 Highlights from our platform initiatives and key metrics from 2024 (,,and Growth Meets Capital)
🔗 A look into our internal operations and how we aim to lead by example
