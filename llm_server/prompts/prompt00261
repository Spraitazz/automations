 POST: By now, there aren't many people left who don't think of me as some kind of AI Luddite. But, let me put it this way, would anyone suggest today that just because the internet revolutionised how we do things, the dotcom bubble want actually a bubble?

I absolutely believe that the use of machine learning in all kinds of scenarios will become commonplace over coming years. I am also convinced that a lot more will be analytical than generative but it's the GenAI hype that will have created the awareness that helped analytical machine learning grow faster.

What l do not believe is that

↘️ 90% of people will be out of a job,
 AI will do much better at anything and everything we have ever tried or hands on,
〽️ everyone who didn't fall for the hype will live in abject poverty.

Next time you want to call me a Luddite, remember that the Luddites were driven by fears that machines would do exactly those things above to them.
