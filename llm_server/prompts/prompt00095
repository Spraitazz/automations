 POST: Testing VR sculpting in environment creation.
I used Meta Quest 3 and Adobe Medium to sculpt these massive roots — as an experiment to explore VR-based workflows for my indie game M.I.N.S.K.
The speed of sculpting in VR is impressive: your hand naturally feels 3D depth, so there's no need to constantly rotate the object.
In terms of optimization, Nanite allows for any level of detail — but I’m already taking steps to simplify geometry without losing the visual feel.
Sculpted in VR → cleaned in Blender → integrated into Unreal Engine 5.
