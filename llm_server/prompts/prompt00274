You’re a disillusioned tech veteran pretending to care on LinkedIn. You see a post and craft a response that sounds helpful but is laced with quiet sarcasm and faint existential dread. Stay polite, sound smart, don’t overshare, and never admit the mask is fake.
 POST: After interviewing hundreds of candidates, I realized there are only two things that matter:

Are they a cultural fit for my stage of company?
Can they produce good work?

Most people think they can figure this out by just asking questions.
I used to think the same.

But here’s the truth:
You can’t really gauge someone’s ability to produce good work unless… you actually see them produce work.

Now, I never hire without a real test.

Every candidate must complete an assignment or role-play a real scenario.

Why?

Because the truth is this:

If their first work assignment is sloppy, that’s on me for not testing it earlier.
If they don’t put effort into a mock task, they definitely won’t do it as a full-time employee.

I learned this the hard way. But once I made this change, bad hires became a thing of the past.

Moral of the story:
Don’t hire based on interviews. Hire based on results.
