 POST: The difference between high-performing and mediocre technical teams rarely comes down to technical skills—it's about psychological safety. 

After leading engineering across multiple startups, I've found that teams where engineers feel safe to admit mistakes, ask 'naive' questions, and challenge established approaches consistently outperform environments where appearances matter more than outcomes.

A powerful question I ask in technical interviews isn't about algorithms—it's 'Tell me about the last time you were wrong about something important.'

How do you actively cultivate safety in your technical culture?
