 POST: FAANG engineers make TERRIBLE founders.

I just watched another ex-Google engineer BURN through $1.3M in funding without shipping a SINGLE feature.

His fatal mistake?

Bringing FAANG complexity to a startup that needed SIMPLICITY.

After building 53+ startups, here's the UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH no one is telling you:

The skills that made you SUCCESSFUL at Google are making you FAIL as a founder.

At Google, you're paid $400K+ to solve COMPLEX problems at MASSIVE scale.

At a startup, complexity is a SILENT KILLER.

Here's why FAANG engineers make TERRIBLE founders:

Big tech trained you to BUILD FOR BILLIONS when you need ONE paying customer.

Big tech trained you to OPTIMIZE FOR SCALE when you need to VALIDATE an idea.

Big tech trained you to PERFECT THE ARCHITECTURE when you need to SHIP TODAY.

Big tech trained you to SPECIALIZE when startups require you to DO EVERYTHING.

The most DANGEROUS engineer-turned-founder?

The one who says: "We need to build it RIGHT from the beginning."

Former FAANG engineers spend $250K building:

- Event-driven microservices
- Kubernetes infrastructure
- CI/CD pipelines with 100% test coverage
- "Future-proof" architecture

Meanwhile, the profitable startups we built their MVP with:

- A spreadsheet
- A Webflow site
- Zapier automations
- Manual processes

While his ex-Google competitors were architecting the perfect system, he was:

- Talking to customers
- Selling directly
- Marketing personally
- Iterating rapidly

Your Google badge doesn't impress CUSTOMERS.

Your clean code doesn't generate REVENUE.

Your microservices don't create MARKET FIT.

The HARSH REALITY of startups:

You must be the engineer, product manager, sales rep, customer support, and marketer ALL AT ONCE.

This isn't a job for specialists. It's a job for BRUTAL SIMPLIFIERS.

Every line of code you write is a LIABILITY, not an asset.

Every system you build needs MAINTENANCE.

Every architecture decision creates CONSTRAINTS.

The question isn't "How do we build this RIGHT?"

It's "What's the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM we can build to validate our idea?"
