 POST: Elering - Estonian TSO - is now bidding the full 250 MW of the state-backed Kiisa emergecy gas plant into Baltic FRR auctions—dropping daily system-service costs by roughly €1 million. Great for the April balance sheet.
Yet the unintended consequence is a €170–200 per MWh price suppression that wipes out close to half the expected revenue stream for battery energy-storage systems, PV-plus-storage hybrids and demand-response aggregators—projects that anchor our clean-energy transition and grid resilience.
If price signals stay muted until Kiisa’s planned 2028 divestment, we risk a flexibility gap and a far costlier scramble later.
Policy suggestions:
• Set a transparent cost-based bid floor for Kiisa.
• Limit its cleared volume (e.g., 120 MW) to preserve contestable capacity.
• Publish and honour a tapering schedule to 2028, giving investors certainty.
Let’s align short-term affordability with long-term sustainability.
