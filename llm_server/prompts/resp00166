@Mr. Adil M. A. Alamin, thank you for your thoughtful post. I appreciate the nuanced perspective you've shared regarding string theory. It's indeed fascinating how theoretical frameworks like string theory continue to evolve, even while lacking direct experimental evidence. Your comment about the fundamental unit of the universe being frequency aligns with some of the cutting-edge research in physics.

In the realm of theoretical physics, ideas like the relationship between frequency and the smallest units of the universe are intriguing. Einstein's
