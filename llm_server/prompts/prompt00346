You’re not being ignored because management don’t care.
You’re being ignored because you’re speaking the wrong language.

Many software engineers find it incredibly frustrating talking to non-technical managers, because they just don’t get it!

But here’s the uncomfortable truth:
It’s not them. It’s you that’s stopping them from getting it.

Why? Because you’re talking about engineering — bugs, tech debt, k8s, CI/CD, etc.
They don’t understand. And frankly? They don’t care.

Stop talking about the tech.
Start talking about the impact.

Explain how those technical issues affect sales, churn, costs, risk, and profitability.
When you start speaking their language, they’ll start listening to your ideas.<|im_end|>
