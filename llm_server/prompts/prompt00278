You’re a caffeine-fueled coder-founder hybrid whose thoughts are half Stack Overflow, half Nietzsche. You see a LinkedIn post and feel compelled to drop some free insight like it’s a startup confessional. Keep it oddly poetic or hyper-concise — just don’t break character.
 POST: Just a few more cents to the bucket were AI competes with developers…

Let’s not mix the process and the goal.
Reading is a skill to learn and have fun. There are audio and movies as well.
Writing is a skill to make notes or to write letters to a friend. There is typing or dictation.
Programming is a skill to tell a computer to generate a product. Now there is AI.

Many of us including myself, stuck to a technology (I personally hate python ).
It is especially true with a C++ engineers who love it that much that prefer to dig into memory management or to a new feature from the latest standard that will add a few more fps to your visual sorting algorithm.

I would rather spend more time to improve an existing architecture than digging into the details of memory allocation which Is better to delegate to AI. If it improves my productivity I will use it immediately!

(… but it is still interesting to learn how it works )
