Hi, I can help with all the 3 sciences subjects (even including maths). Some background info: I finished Masters in Imperial (1st class) and doing PhD Bioengineering in imperial too. Here is one of my success story: 
              
                Featured in BBC news - 12 years old got 3 A* with 9s in GCSEs, 9 years old got two 9s in GCSE. Other students jumped from 3 to 5 or 6 to 9 in GCSEs or D to A for A levels. I have successfully also sent students to oxbridge and imperial/ucl. 
              
                I have achieved 90-100% for my GCSE + Alevel Maths (100%) and 3 sciences. I have gained silver in my maths, biology and chemistry olympiad. I have wrote model answers for GCSE Maths and sciences for various examboards recently for PMT Education. I have pulled up many student`s grades previously (e.g. from 3 to 8 or someone who failed to pass their exam or move foundation to higher tier) I am currently tutoring KS3 to A level students for maths and 3 sciences in various tuition companies (including NewGenTutor where it helps homeschool students) and privately (for 6 years) so I am very knowledgeable. 
              
                Also, I am friendly, engaging and encouraging and a great listener. I can give tips and understanding and exam tips beyond schools give. I can prepare questions in various difficulty levels to push the student`s limits beyond what they expected. Currently one of year 7 student`s ability got boost up to year 9 standards or a 10 years old got high 9 in maths GCSE this year and preparing for science exam next year! Someone who got 50% in during their A levels got 85% now after 2 months of lessons! I also offer detailed notes and question banks.
