Hello Gun cuk, my name is Kevin. I am a fully qualified physics teacher and tutor with double masters degrees from Cambridge university. I have 15 years experience teaching GCSE Physics and Science in the British education system with various exam boards. 
            
              
            
              I can help my students understand difficult concepts and maximise their performance in exams. I use a combination of PowerPoint presentations, example questions and exercises, and use an interactive shared online whiteboard, so we can both draw diagrams and write equations easily to make it easier to answer questions. 
            
              
            
              My teaching style is relaxed, and I try to make the lessons interesting whilst keeping them effective. Please get back to me if you want to hire me.
            
              
            
              Thank you!
